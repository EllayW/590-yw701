68,six or seven of us were sitting one day after tea ,0,train

70,others were idly occupied in building little towers of sugar upon the edge of the tea tray ,0,val
71,after a time  so far as i can remember  we drew round the fire and began as usual to praise men  how strong  how noble  how brilliant  how courageous  how beautiful they were  how we envied those who by hook or by crook managed to get attached to one for life  when poll  who had said nothing  burst into tears ,0,val
72,poll  i must tell you  has always been queer ,0,train
73,for one thing her father was a strange man ,0,train
74,he left her a fortune in his will  but on condition that she read all the books in the london library ,0,train
75,we comforted her as best we could  but we knew in our hearts how vain it was ,0,train
76,for though we like her  poll is no beauty  leaves her shoe laces untied  and must have been thinking  while we praised men  that not one of them would ever wish to marry her ,0,val
77,at last she dried her tears ,0,test
78,for some time we could make nothing of what she said ,0,train
79,strange enough it was in all conscience ,0,test
80,she told us that  as we knew  she spent most of her time in the london library  reading ,0,val
81,she had begun  she said  with english literature on the top floor  and was steadily working her way down to the  times  on the bottom ,0,train
82,and now half  or perhaps only a quarter  way through a terrible thing had happened ,0,train
83,she could read no more ,0,train
84,books were not what we thought them ,0,val
85, books   she cried  rising to her feet and speaking with an intensity of desolation which i shall never forget   are for the most part unutterably bad  ,0,train
86,of course we cried out that shakespeare wrote books  and milton and shelley ,0,val
87, oh  yes   she interrupted us ,0,train
88, you ve been well taught  i can see ,0,train
89,but you are not members of the london library  ,0,val
90,here her sobs broke forth anew ,0,train
91,at length  recovering a little  she opened one of the pile of books which she always carried about with her   from a window  or  in a garden   or some such name as that it was called  and it was written by a man called benton or henson  or something of that kind ,0,train
92,she read the first few pages ,0,train
93,we listened in silence ,0,train
94, but that s not a book   someone said ,0,test
95,so she chose another ,0,train
96,this time it was a history  but i have forgotten the writer s name ,0,val
97,our trepidation increased as she went on ,0,train
98,not a word of it seemed to be true  and the style in which it was written was execrable ,0,test

100,poetry  ,0,train
101,we cried  impatiently ,0,val
102, read us poetry  ,0,test
103,i cannot describe the desolation which fell upon us as she opened a little volume and mouthed out the verbose  sentimental foolery which it contained ,0,test
104, it must have been written by a woman   one of us urged ,0,train
105,but no ,0,train
106,she told us that it was written by a young man  one of the most famous poets of the day ,0,val
107,i leave you to imagine what the shock of the discovery was ,0,train
108,though we all cried and begged her to read no more  she persisted and read us extracts from the lives of the lord chancellors ,0,test
109,when she had finished  jane  the eldest and wisest of us  rose to her feet and said that she for one was not convinced ,0,val
110, why   she asked   if men write such rubbish as this  should our mothers have wasted their youth in bringing them into the world  ,0,test
111,we were all silent  and  in the silence  poor poll could be heard sobbing out   why  why did my father teach me to read  ,0,train
112,clorinda was the first to come to her senses ,0,val
113, it s all our fault   she said ,0,val
114, every one of us knows how to read ,0,test
115,but no one  save poll  has ever taken the trouble to do it ,0,train
116,i  for one  have taken it for granted that it was a woman s duty to spend her youth in bearing children ,0,train
117,i venerated my mother for bearing ten  still more my grandmother for bearing fifteen  it was  i confess  my own ambition to bear twenty ,0,test
118,we have gone on all these ages supposing that men were equally industrious  and that their works were of equal merit ,0,test
119,while we have borne the children  they  we supposed  have borne the books and the pictures ,0,train
120,we have populated the world ,0,train
121,they have civilized it ,0,train
122,but now that we can read  what prevents us from judging the results ,0,test
123,before we bring another child into the world we must swear that we will find out what the world is like  ,0,train
124,so we made ourselves into a society for asking questions ,0,train
125,one of us was to visit a man of war  another was to hide herself in a scholar s study  another was to attend a meeting of business men  while all were to read books  look at pictures  go to concerts  keep our eyes open in the streets  and ask questions perpetually ,0,train
126,we were very young ,0,train
127,you can judge of our simplicity when i tell you that before parting that night we agreed that the objects of life were to produce good people and good books ,0,val
128,our questions were to be directed to finding out how far these objects were now attained by men ,0,test
129,we vowed solemnly that we would not bear a single child until we were satisfied ,0,train
130,off we went then  some to the british museum  others to the king s navy  some to oxford  others to cambridge  we visited the royal academy and the tate  heard modern music in concert rooms  went to the law courts  and saw new plays ,0,val
131,no one dined out without asking her partner certain questions and carefully noting his replies ,0,train
132,at intervals we met together and compared our observations ,0,val
133,oh  those were merry meetings ,0,train
134,never have i laughed so much as i did when rose read her notes upon  honour  and described how she had dressed herself as an  thiopian prince and gone aboard one of his majesty s ships ,0,train
135,discovering the hoax  the captain visited her  now disguised as a private gentleman  and demanded that honour should be satisfied ,0,val
136, but how  ,0,test
137,she asked ,0,test
138, how  ,0,val
139,he bellowed ,0,val
140, with the cane of course  ,0,val
141,seeing that he was beside himself with rage and expecting that her last moment had come  she bent over and received  to her amazement  six light taps upon the behind ,0,train
142, the honour of the british navy is avenged  ,0,val
143,he cried  and  raising herself  she saw him with the sweat pouring down his face holding out a trembling right hand ,0,train
144, away  ,0,train
145,she exclaimed  striking an attitude and imitating the ferocity of his own expression   my honour has still to be satisfied  ,0,test
146, spoken like a gentleman  ,0,train
147,he returned  and fell into profound thought ,0,train
148, if six strokes avenge the honour of the king s navy   he mused   how many avenge the honour of a private gentleman  ,0,test
149,he said he would prefer to lay the case before his brother officers ,0,train
150,she replied haughtily that she could not wait ,0,train
151,he praised her sensibility ,0,train
152, let me see   he cried suddenly   did your father keep a carriage  ,0,train
153, no   she said ,0,test
154, or a riding horse  ,0,val
155, we had a donkey   she bethought her   which drew the mowing machine  ,0,val
156,at this his face lighted ,0,train
157, my mother s name      she added ,0,test
158, for god s sake  man  don t mention your mother s name  ,0,test
159,he shrieked  trembling like an aspen and flushing to the roots of his hair  and it was ten minutes at least before she could induce him to proceed ,0,val
160,at length he decreed that if she gave him four strokes and a half in the small of the back at a spot indicated by himself  the half conceded  he said  in recognition of the fact that her great grandmother s uncle was killed at trafalgar  it was his opinion that her honour would be as good as new ,0,test
161,this was done  they retired to a restaurant  drank two bottles of wine for which he insisted upon paying  and parted with protestations of eternal friendship ,0,train
162,then we had fanny s account of her visit to the law courts ,0,train
163,at her first visit she had come to the conclusion that the judges were either made of wood or were impersonated by large animals resembling man who had been trained to move with extreme dignity  mumble and nod their heads ,0,train
164,to test her theory she had liberated a handkerchief of bluebottles at the critical moment of a trial  but was unable to judge whether the creatures gave signs of humanity for the buzzing of the flies induced so sound a sleep that she only woke in time to see the prisoners led into the cells below ,0,train
165,but from the evidence she brought we voted that it is unfair to suppose that the judges are men ,0,test
166,helen went to the royal academy  but when asked to deliver her report upon the pictures she began to recite from a pale blue volume   o ,0,val
167,for the touch of a vanished hand and the sound of a voice that is still ,0,train
168,home is the hunter  home from the hill ,0,train

175,the path of duty is the way to glory    we could listen to no more of this gibberish ,0,train
176, we want no more poetry  ,0,test
177,we cried ,0,val
178, daughters of england  ,0,test
179,she began  but here we pulled her down  a vase of water getting spilt over her in the scuffle ,0,train
180, thank god  ,0,train
181,she exclaimed  shaking herself like a dog ,0,train
182, now i ll roll on the carpet and see if i can t brush off what remains of the union jack ,0,train
183,then perhaps    here she rolled energetically ,0,train
184,getting up she began to explain to us what modern pictures are like when castalia stopped her ,0,train
185, what is the average size of a picture  ,0,train
186,she asked ,0,val
187, perhaps two feet by two and a half   she said ,0,test
188,castalia made notes while helen spoke  and when she had done  and we were trying not to meet each other s eyes  rose and said   at your wish i spent last week at oxbridge  disguised as a charwoman ,0,train
189,i thus had access to the rooms of several professors and will now attempt to give you some idea  only   she broke off   i can t think how to do it ,0,train
190,it s all so queer ,0,train
191,these professors   she went on   live in large houses built round grass plots each in a kind of cell by himself ,0,train
192,yet they have every convenience and comfort ,0,test
193,you have only to press a button or light a little lamp ,0,train
194,their papers are beautifully filed ,0,train
195,books abound ,0,train
196,there are no children or animals  save half a dozen stray cats and one aged bullfinch  a cock ,0,train
197,i remember   she broke off   an aunt of mine who lived at dulwich and kept cactuses ,0,train
198,you reached the conservatory through the double drawing room  and there  on the hot pipes  were dozens of them  ugly  squat  bristly little plants each in a separate pot ,0,train
199,once in a hundred years the aloe flowered  so my aunt said ,0,train
200,but she died before that happened    we told her to keep to the point ,0,test
201, well   she resumed   when professor hobkin was out  i examined his life work  an edition of sappho ,0,train
202,it s a queer looking book  six or seven inches thick  not all by sappho ,0,train
203,oh  no ,0,val
204,most of it is a defence of sappho s chastity  which some german had denied  and i can assure you the passion with which these two gentlemen argued  the learning they displayed  the prodigious ingenuity with which they disputed the use of some implement which looked to me for all the world like a hairpin astounded me  especially when the door opened and professor hobkin himself appeared ,0,train
205,a very nice  mild  old gentleman  but what could  he  know about chastity  ,0,test
206,we misunderstood her ,0,train
207, no  no   she protested   he s the soul of honour i m sure  not that he resembles rose s sea captain in the least ,0,test
208,i was thinking rather of my aunt s cactuses ,0,train
209,what could  they  know about chastity  ,0,train
210,again we told her not to wander from the point   did the oxbridge professors help to produce good people and good books   the objects of life ,0,train
211, there  ,0,train
212,she exclaimed ,0,train
213, it never struck me to ask ,0,train
214,it never occurred to me that they could possibly produce anything  ,0,val
215, i believe   said sue   that you made some mistake ,0,train
216,probably professor hobkin was a gyn cologist ,0,test
217,a scholar is a very different sort of man ,0,train
218,a scholar is overflowing with humour and invention  perhaps addicted to wine  but what of that   a delightful companion  generous  subtle  imaginative  as stands to reason ,0,train
219,for he spends his life in company with the finest human beings that have ever existed  ,0,train
220, hum   said castalia ,0,val
221, perhaps i d better go back and try again  ,0,train
222,some three months later it happened that i was sitting alone when castalia entered ,0,train
223,i don t know what it was in the look of her that so moved me  but i could not restrain myself  and  dashing across the room  i clasped her in my arms ,0,train
224,not only was she very beautiful  she seemed also in the highest spirits ,0,train
225, how happy you look  ,0,test
226,i exclaimed  as she sat down ,0,val
227, i ve been at oxbridge   she said ,0,train
228, asking questions  ,0,train
229, answering them   she replied ,0,train
230, you have not broken our vow  ,0,train
231,i said anxiously  noticing something about her figure ,0,train
232, oh  the vow   she said casually ,0,train
233, i m going to have a baby  if that s what you mean ,0,train
234,you can t imagine   she burst out   how exciting  how beautiful  how satisfying      what is  ,0,test
235,i asked ,0,train
236, to  to  answer questions   she replied in some confusion ,0,train
237,whereupon she told me the whole of her story ,0,val
238,but in the middle of an account which interested and excited me more than anything i had ever heard  she gave the strangest cry  half whoop  half holloa     chastity ,0,test
239,chastity ,0,train
240,where s my chastity  ,0,train
241,she cried ,0,train
242, help ho ,0,val
243,the scent bottle  ,0,val
244,there was nothing in the room but a cruet containing mustard  which i was about to administer when she recovered her composure ,0,train
245, you should have thought of that three months ago   i said severely ,0,test
246, true   she replied ,0,test
247, there s not much good in thinking of it now ,0,train
248,it was unfortunate  by the way  that my mother had me called castalia  ,0,train
249, oh  castalia  your mother    i was beginning when she reached for the mustard pot ,0,val
250, no  no  no   she said  shaking her head ,0,train
251, if you d been a chaste woman yourself you would have screamed at the sight of me  instead of which you rushed across the room and took me in your arms ,0,train
252,no  cassandra ,0,train
253,we are neither of us chaste  ,0,train
254,so we went on talking ,0,train
255,meanwhile the room was filling up  for it was the day appointed to discuss the results of our observations ,0,train
256,everyone  i thought  felt as i did about castalia ,0,test
257,they kissed her and said how glad they were to see her again ,0,train
258,at length  when we were all assembled  jane rose and said that it was time to begin ,0,train
259,she began by saying that we had now asked questions for over five years  and that though the results were bound to be inconclusive  here castalia nudged me and whispered that she was not so sure about that ,0,test
260,then she got up  and  interrupting jane in the middle of a sentence  said    before you say any more  i want to know  am i to stay in the room ,0,train
261,because   she added   i have to confess that i am an impure woman  ,0,test
262,everyone looked at her in astonishment ,0,val
263, you are going to have a baby  ,0,train
264,asked jane ,0,train
265,she nodded her head ,0,train
266,it was extraordinary to see the different expressions on their faces ,0,test
267,a sort of hum went through the room  in which i could catch the words  impure    baby    castalia   and so on ,0,train
268,jane  who was herself considerably moved  put it to us    shall she go ,0,train
269,is she impure  ,0,train
270,such a roar filled the room as might have been heard in the street outside ,0,val
271, no ,0,train
272,no ,0,test
273,no ,0,train
274,let her stay ,0,train
275,impure ,0,test
276,fiddlesticks  ,0,test
277,yet i fancied that some of the youngest  girls of nineteen or twenty  held back as if overcome with shyness ,0,val
278,then we all came about her and began asking questions  and at last i saw one of the youngest  who had kept in the background  approach shyly and say to her    what is chastity then ,0,test
279,i mean is it good  or is it bad  or is it nothing at all  ,0,train
280,she replied so low that i could not catch what she said ,0,train
281, you know i was shocked   said another   for at least ten minutes  ,0,train
282, in my opinion   said poll  who was growing crusty from always reading in the london library   chastity is nothing but ignorance  a most discreditable state of mind ,0,test
283,we should admit only the unchaste to our society ,0,train
284,i vote that castalia shall be our president  ,0,test
285,this was violently disputed ,0,val
286, it is as unfair to brand women with chastity as with unchastity   said poll ,0,train
287, some of us haven t the opportunity either ,0,test
288,moreover  i don t believe cassy herself maintains that she acted as she did from a pure love of knowledge  ,0,train
289, he is only twenty one and divinely beautiful   said cassy  with a ravishing gesture ,0,train
290, i move   said helen   that no one be allowed to talk of chastity or unchastity save those who are in love  ,0,test
291, oh  bother   said judith  who had been enquiring into scientific matters   i m not in love and i m longing to explain my measures for dispensing with prostitutes and fertilizing virgins by act of parliament  ,0,train
292,she went on to tell us of an invention of hers to be erected at tube stations and other public resorts  which  upon payment of a small fee  would safeguard the nation s health  accommodate its sons  and relieve its daughters ,0,train
293,then she had contrived a method of preserving in sealed tubes the germs of future lord chancellors  or poets or painters or musicians   she went on   supposing  that is to say  that these breeds are not extinct  and that women still wish to bear children        of course we wish to bear children  ,0,train
294,cried castalia  impatiently ,0,train
295,jane rapped the table ,0,train
296, that is the very point we are met to consider   she said ,0,train
297, for five years we have been trying to find out whether we are justified in continuing the human race ,0,train
298,castalia has anticipated our decision ,0,train
299,but it remains for the rest of us to make up our minds  ,0,train
300,here one after another of our messengers rose and delivered their reports ,0,train
301,the marvels of civilisation far exceeded our expectations  and  as we learnt for the first time how man flies in the air  talks across space  penetrates to the heart of an atom  and embraces the universe in his speculations  a murmur of admiration burst from our lips ,0,train
302, we are proud   we cried   that our mothers sacrificed their youth in such a cause as this  ,0,train
303,castalia  who had been listening intently  looked prouder than all the rest ,0,val
304,then jane reminded us that we had still much to learn  and castalia begged us to make haste ,0,train
305,on we went through a vast tangle of statistics ,0,train
306,we learnt that england has a population of so many millions  and that such and such a proportion of them is constantly hungry and in prison  that the average size of a working man s family is such  and that so great a percentage of women die from maladies incident to childbirth ,0,train

309,the british colonies were now discussed  and some account was given of our rule in india  africa and ireland ,0,train
310,i was sitting by castalia and i noticed her uneasiness ,0,train
311, we shall never come to any conclusion at all at this rate   she said ,0,train
312, as it appears that civilisation is so much more complex than we had any notion  would it not be better to confine ourselves to our original enquiry ,0,train
313,we agreed that it was the object of life to produce good people and good books ,0,train
314,all this time we have been talking of aeroplanes  factories  and money ,0,val
315,let us talk about men themselves and their arts  for that is the heart of the matter  ,0,train
316,so the diners out stepped forward with long slips of paper containing answers to their questions ,0,train
317,these had been framed after much consideration ,0,val
318,a good man  we had agreed  must at any rate be honest  passionate  and unworldly ,0,val

331,their wives wished that too  or perhaps it was the british empire ,0,train
332,but more significant than the answers were the refusals to answer ,0,train
333,very few would reply at all to questions about morality and religion  and such answers as were given were not serious ,0,train
334,questions as to the value of money and power were almost invariably brushed aside  or pressed at extreme risk to the asker ,0,train
335, i m sure   said jill   that if sir harley tightboots hadn t been carving the mutton when i asked him about the capitalist system he would have cut my throat ,0,train
336,the only reason why we escaped with our lives over and over again is that men are at once so hungry and so chivalrous ,0,train
337,they despise us too much to mind what we say  ,0,train
338, of course they despise us   said eleanor ,0,test

369, good books  ,0,train
370,she said  looking at the ceiling ,0,train
371, you must remember   she began  speaking with extreme rapidity   that fiction is the mirror of life ,0,test
372,and you can t deny that education is of the highest importance  and that it would be extremely annoying  if you found yourself alone at brighton late at night  not to know which was the best boarding house to stay at  and suppose it was a dripping sunday evening  wouldn t it be nice to go to the movies  ,0,test
373, but what has that got to do with it  ,0,train

379,we demanded ,0,train
380, oh  the truth   she stammered   the truth has nothing to do with literature   and sitting down she refused to say another word ,0,val
381,it all seemed to us very inconclusive ,0,train

973,after looking at it for a moment in some confusion the old man bent his ear to it and seemed to answer a voice speaking from it  for he began talking about the forests of uruguay which he had visited hundreds of years ago in company with the most beautiful young woman in europe ,0,train
974,he could be heard murmuring about forests of uruguay blanketed with the wax petals of tropical roses  nightingales  sea beaches  mermaids  and women drowned at sea  as he suffered himself to be moved on by william  upon whose face the look of stoical patience grew slowly deeper and deeper ,0,val
975,following his steps so closely as to be slightly puzzled by his gestures came two elderly women of the lower middle class  one stout and ponderous  the other rosy cheeked and nimble ,0,train
976,like most people of their station they were frankly fascinated by any signs of eccentricity betokening a disordered brain  especially in the well to do  but they were too far off to be certain whether the gestures were merely eccentric or genuinely mad ,0,train
977,after they had scrutinised the old man s back in silence for a moment and given each other a queer  sly look  they went on energetically piecing together their very complicated dialogue    nell  bert  lot  cess  phil  pa  he says  i says  she says  i says  i says  i says        my bert  sis  bill  grandad  the old man  sugar         sugar  flour  kippers  greens       sugar  sugar  sugar  ,0,val

982,then she suggested that they should find a seat and have their tea ,0,test
983,the snail had now considered every possible method of reaching his goal without going round the dead leaf or climbing over it ,0,train
984,let alone the effort needed for climbing a leaf  he was doubtful whether the thin texture which vibrated with such an alarming crackle when touched even by the tip of his horns would bear his weight  and this determined him finally to creep beneath it  for there was a point where the leaf curved high enough from the ground to admit him ,0,train
985,he had just inserted his head in the opening and was taking stock of the high brown roof and was getting used to the cool brown light when two other people came past outside on the turf ,0,train

997,the couple stood still on the edge of the flower bed  and together pressed the end of her parasol deep down into the soft earth ,0,val
998,the action and the fact that his hand rested on the top of hers expressed their feelings in a strange way  as these short insignificant words also expressed something  words with short wings for their heavy body of meaning  inadequate to carry them far and thus alighting awkwardly upon the very common objects that surrounded them  and were to their inexperienced touch so massive  but who knows  so they thought as they pressed the parasol into the earth  what precipices aren t concealed in them  or what slopes of ice don t shine in the sun on the other side ,0,train

1005,thus one couple after another with much the same irregular and aimless movement passed the flower bed and were enveloped in layer after layer of green blue vapour  in which at first their bodies had substance and a dash of colour  but later both substance and colour dissolved in the green blue atmosphere ,0,test

1007,so hot that even the thrush chose to hop  like a mechanical bird  in the shadow of the flowers  with long pauses between one movement and the next  instead of rambling vaguely the white butterflies danced one above another  making with their white shifting flakes the outline of a shattered marble column above the tallest flowers  the glass roofs of the palm house shone as if a whole market full of shiny green umbrellas had opened in the sun  and in the drone of the aeroplane the voice of the summer sky murmured its fierce soul ,0,train
1008,yellow and black  pink and snow white  shapes of all these colours  men  women  and children were spotted for a second upon the horizon  and then  seeing the breadth of yellow that lay upon the grass  they wavered and sought shade beneath the trees  dissolving like drops of water in the yellow and green atmosphere  staining it faintly with red and blue ,0,test

1019,rather to my relief the sight of the mark interrupted the fancy  for it is an old fancy  an automatic fancy  made as a child perhaps ,0,train

1264,these men have carried forward the analysis which their fathers  or let us say their elder brothers  had begun  to such a point that there are no words in it which are meaningless  no factors which are not reduced to terms of human nature ,1,train
1265,they did nothing but add the last link to a chain of logic ,1,train
1266,their predecessors discovered the machine  and spent their lives in trying to belong to a party without strengthening its machine ,1,val
1267,these latter men discovered that both parties were ruled by the same machine ,1,train
1268,they see one issue  and only one issue in american politics  namely  the attack on that machine ,1,train
1269,moreover  these men have political initiative  that is to say  they contemplate creating conditions  and not merely making transient use of visible conditions ,1,train
1270,their idea is so simple that any one whose mind is not warped by the cant of party politics understands it at once ,1,train
1271, all this political corruption is a unity ,1,train
1272,vote against it and you will beat it ,1,val
1273,vote for any part of it and you strengthen it   this sounds simple ,1,test
1274,but in practice the prejudices  the interests  the passions and political temperament of the whole population are against it ,1,val
1275,every argument that the people understand is against this course ,1,train
1276,everything that either party fears or hates in the other party is passionately pointed out as a reason against independent voting ,1,train
1277,according to republicans  independent voting involves  allowing croker to extend his rule over the entire state   and  enabling tammany hall to control the judiciary   and  endangering the cause of sound money   according to democrats  it involves the encouraging of trusts  tariffs  pensions  expansion and foreign conquest ,1,train
1278,according to both democrats and republicans  independent voting is  voting in the air   and is at odds with the spirit of our institutions  which contemplate two parties and no more ,1,test
1279,and  finally  every one condemns the independent because he violates that thumb rule which slovenly thinkers regard as a summary of all political philosophy   between two evils choose the least    now the answer to all these arguments is that they are the merest mirage ,1,val
1280,it makes no difference which of the two evils  platt or croker  has the name of ruling the state ,1,train
1281,at present they divide the rule between them ,1,test
1282,they can do no more ,1,test
1283,there is no argument that can be used against tammany hall which is powerful enough to make the republican ring trustworthy ,1,train
1284,there is no argument against expansion so excessively convincing that it changes the moral character of the democratic party ,1,test
1285,these learned arguments are useless  ludicrous  pathetic  irrational  impotent  contemptible ,1,train
1286,they do but distract us from the real issue  which is personal corruption ,1,train
1287,where shall a man cast his vote against it ,1,train
1288,if i turn out mckinley because he bleeds the natives  i put in a democrat to bleed the natives ,1,test
1289,if the whitewashing of alger arouses public indignation  tammany hall feeds at the trough ,1,val
1290,if croker s control of the judiciary arouses popular indignation  platt s pigs feed at the trough ,1,train
1291,as for sound money  we have already elected one congress on the issue in       just as in      we elected a congress on the tariff issue ,1,train
1292,what was done ,1,test
1293,why  in each case that was done which the ring wanted done   nothing ,1,train
1294,which national party stands for an idea to day ,1,val
1295,the only shadow of reason for believing that either does  is that the republicans cried sound money and won ,1,test
1296,they have done nothing ,1,test
1297,had bryan won  he would have done nothing  could have done nothing ,1,val
1298,there are no issues in american politics save this one issue of common honesty ,1,val
1299,you cannot throw an issue into this whirlpool of vice  for your issue turns to cash by the contact ,1,train
1300,we need not waste our time reading the platforms drawn by platt and croker ,1,train
1301,we must not vote for any man who does not go into public life as their enemy  because we know that in so far as he is not their enemy he is ours ,1,train
1302,as for these dreadful consequences that are always about to follow from a refusal to support one end of the iniquity  they do not follow ,1,test
1303,we have the evils now ,1,val
1304,we are at the worst ,1,train
1305,the powers of darkness may conspire and heap all in ruins  but they must not prevent us from beginning upon a constructive line to draw together and build up the powers of light ,1,test
1306,nor is there the smallest distinction either in the evil or its cure  between the case of a village  of a state  or of the whole nation ,1,train
1307,say you live in a town  you can only get a clean school board by running men against both the regular parties ,1,train
1308,there is no other way of getting rid of hanna and the presidential syndicate than by running an independent candidate for the presidency ,1,train
1309,no form of bryanism will oust it   no rump democracy nor any kind of democracy ,1,test
1310,democracy is finished ,1,val
1311,republicanism is finished ,1,val
1312,this is the zero point of party loyalty ,1,test
1313,it has been reached very slowly ,1,train
1314,it means open war ,1,val
1315,the citizen is now confronted with a third ticket  which is a deliberate insult to both the others ,1,val
1316,no matter what the conditions  it is an appeal which disintegrates the emotions of the voter ,1,val
1317,this is the very elixir of reform ,1,val
1318,people are forced to think ,1,train
1319,it hurts them ,1,train
1320,they cry out against those who create the dilemma  but they cannot escape it ,1,train
1321,the vote you poll will vary ,1,test
1322,if the party war cries are intense and the party candidates promise fairly  very few men will see the point of your movement ,1,train
1323,but no one escapes its influence ,1,test
1324,let us say that five thousand vote your ticket ,1,train
1325,these are the only men whose response is scheduled ,1,train
1326,but the political vision of five hundred thousand has been quickened ,1,test
1327,no atom of this influence is lost ,1,train
1328,the work was done when the vote was cast ,1,train
1329,even if it be not counted at all  it will show in every political camp in the near future ,1,train
1330,but do you ever have outward success ,1,val
1331,does the time ever come when the standards of every one are so high that the parties themselves present candidates as good as your own  and there is no excuse for your existence ,1,val
1332,that depends upon the trend of the age ,1,train
1333,one thing only is certain  that by pursuing this course you are doing all that you can do ,1,test
1334,you are wasting no power ,1,train
1335,no part of your force is helping the enemy ,1,val
1336,after all  the great discovery is a very simple thing ,1,train
1337,we have found  after many experiments  that what we really want is  not the turning out of officials  not the enactment of laws  but the raising of the general standards ,1,train
1338,the way to do this is to set up a standard ,1,train
1339,of course nobody likes to find a foot rule laid against his shortage ,1,test
1340,even the vocabulary of the average man is attacked by such a system ,1,train
1341,words like  courage    honesty    independence    pledge    loyalty  pass current like clipped coin in the language of politics  and the keying up of words to their biblical value brings out one man a thief and the next a hypocrite ,1,val
1342,all these civic commotions  great and small  that surge up and are scattered  that form and reform  the people s leagues and citizens  unions  are the altruism of the community fighting its way to the surface through the obstructions  the snares  and the oppressions of the organized world ,1,train
1343,no discouragement sets it back ,1,train
1344,no betrayal destroys it ,1,train
1345,the people come forward with ever new faith ,1,train
1346,what ceaseless endeavor ,1,train

1354,one enthusiast calls twenty friends into a room and organizes a club  and the club ties his hands and sells out to the nearest bidder ,1,val
1355,before he knows it he has been organized back into tammany hall ,1,train
1356,you begin with a call to arms and a plan of organization ,1,test
1357,the men come to you in a moment of hope  showing every shade of intelligence  every stage of opinion   one because he believes in your candidate  one because he hates tammany hall  one because he wants prominence  all because they do not expect to be alone ,1,test
1358,the men who volunteer have not a clear notion of what they are in for ,1,val

1365,your muster shows the vague hope of a lot of men who are utterly incompetent  undisciplined  ignorant ,1,train

1373,you think that what is needed is to raise a standard ,1,train
1374,you call your twenty friends about you ,1,train
1375,they are not corrupt ,1,val
1376,nevertheless  let us see who they will be ,1,train
1377,we are not dealing with an imaginary community  but with american citizens as they exist  with men every one of whom trusts his instincts to a different extent ,1,train
1378,each man believes in principle in the abstract  but thinks it is sometimes hopeless to be severely virtuous in politics ,1,val
1379,this  sometimes  is the  crux  ,1,test

1383,it is never hopeless ,1,train
1384,absolute honesty is always the way ,1,val
1385,but an age of corruption destroys faith ,1,test
1386,this is the essential injury ,1,train
1387,this is the disease ,1,test
1388,you yourself have a little stronger belief  a little more political enterprise than your twenty friends ,1,test
1389,otherwise it would be they who were summoning you to a conference ,1,train
1390,it is certain that their joint wisdom will result in action less radical than you believe in ,1,train
1391,they outvote you in council ,1,train
1392,the standard they set up is not absolute ,1,test
1393,but this outcome will prevent you from making your point at all ,1,train
1394,if you are to back your friends up publicly and are honest yourself  all you can say will be   here s a makeshift   now  the public instinct understands this very well already ,1,train
1395,ten per cent of your own faith you have compromised ,1,train
1396,it has cost you ninety per cent of your educational power  for the heart of man will respond only to a true thing ,1,train
1397,what is it that has led you to compromise ,1,test
1398,why  the age you live in ,1,train
1399,you yourself  being afraid to stand alone  have dipped your flag  with the best intentions  because you cannot see that any other course is practicable ,1,test
1400,yet you yourself can keep your own intellectual integrity only at the price of destroying your own handiwork ,1,train
1401,if you do not destroy it  you are a hypocrite ,1,test
1402,here in the room with you were twenty men  the very flower of the idealism of the town  not chosen by accident  but coming together by natural selection ,1,test
1403,twenty more like them do not exist in the community  for their activity would have revealed them ,1,test

1405,nay  they hang on your arms and prevent you from raising one ,1,test
1406,if you are to do it  you must do it alone ,1,train
1407,then these men will be the first to denounce you  for your act damns them ,1,train
1408,you can only be true to the public conscience by rebuking your friends ,1,test
1409,if you fail to do this  your banner is submerged ,1,train
1410,let us consider the cause of this weakness in reform organizations ,1,train
1411,you wish to appeal to the people with as good a show of names as you can ,1,val
1412,and so you get a lot of well known men to indorse you ,1,train
1413,this is considered practical ,1,val
1414,let us see if it is ,1,test
1415,we are fighting tammany hall ,1,train
1416,but no one will for an instant admit that every tammany man is dishonest ,1,train
1417,the corruption we started out to correct was a corruption of the intelligence  a bad habit  a defect of vision ,1,test
1418,the same defect keeps republicans in line for platt  because he is the party  a recognized agent of the community ,1,train
1419,the same defect prevents a just man from joining a new movement unless banker jones is leading it ,1,test
1420,the habit of the community is to rely on some one else to govern them ,1,train
1421,no man trusts himself ,1,test
1422,the machine  upon analysis  turns out to be a lack of self reliance ,1,val
1423,wherever you see a man who gives some one else s corruption  some one else s prejudice as a reason for not taking action himself  you see a cog in the machine that governs us ,1,train
1424,the proof of it is that he will dissuade you from striking the iniquity ,1,val
1425,he will explain that you can t try it without doing more harm than good ,1,train
1426,you will find that at every point of defence  from the arguments of mr  croker himself to the arguments of some sainted college president  the reasons given are identical ,1,train
1427,i cannot find any one who defends stealing ,1,train
1428,they only deprecate action as being inexpedient ,1,test
1429,now  then  if i ask a voter to join my organization  and use as a bait an appeal to this very weakness  his reliance upon other men s opinion  can i hope to make much headway ,1,train
1430,i am taking in just so much of tammany hall ,1,train
1431,my whole body becomes an adjunct of tammany  in the same sense that mr  platt s machine is an adjunct ,1,val
1432,i am croker s last outpost ,1,test
1433,i stand there calling myself reform  and yet i do not act ,1,train
1434,some one else must now come forward and try his hand ,1,train
1435,this process of ebullition  and thereupon stagnation  has happened again and again ,1,train
1436,i suppose there are a dozen extant wrecks of reform political organizations in the city ,1,train
1437,many people have despaired altogether ,1,val
1438,they think it is a law of god that political organizations become corrupt in the second year ,1,train
1439,the experience is entirely due to the persistent putting of new wine into old bottles ,1,train
1440,in their names and hopes these bodies have stood for purity  but in their membership they have  even in their inception  stood for prejudice ,1,train
1441,then  too  the bottles bore good labels  and bad wine was soon poured into them ,1,train
1442,a political organization is a transferable commodity ,1,train
1443,you could not find a better way of killing virtue than by packing it into one of these contraptions which some gang of thieves is sure to find useful ,1,train
1444,the short lesson that comes out of long experience in political agitation is something like this   all  the motive power in all of these movements is the instinct of religious feeling ,1,train
1445,all the obstruction comes from attempting to rely on anything else ,1,test
1446,conciliation is the enemy ,1,val
1447,it is just as impossible to help reform by conciliating prejudice as it is by buying votes ,1,test
1448,prejudice is the enemy ,1,train
1449,whoever is not for you is against you ,1,train
1450,what  then  must the enthusiast do in the way of organization ,1,train
1451,let him go ahead and do some particular thing  and ask the public to help him do it ,1,val
1452,he will thus get behind him whatever force exists at that especial time for that especial purpose ,1,train
1453,it may not be much  but no amount of letterheads and great seals will increase it ,1,test

1460,do not think you are wasting your time  even if no one joins you ,1,train
1461,the prejudice against the individual is part of the evil you are fighting ,1,test
1462,if you keep on in a consistent line of action  people will come to you one by one  and your group will grow into a sort of centre of influence ,1,train
1463,there will result a unity of method as well as of aim  which  as your purposes become understood  will enable you to act with the speed of thought and the force of an avalanche ,1,train
1464,one great merit of this method will be that your whole policy will remain an enigma to every one except those who really want what you want  namely  to raise the general standards ,1,test
1465,only such men will seek you out ,1,test
1466,any one else is a danger ,1,test
1467,thus your organization will grow slowly  but will remain uncapturable  un get at able  an influence  a menace  a standard ,1,train
1468,as fast as adherents appear  you can set up centre after centre of enlightenment  preparatory to your campaigns  debates  pamphlets  correspondence  the battery of agitation ,1,train
1469,and in the mean time the benefit done to the workers themselves is worth all the pains ,1,test
1470,by adopting formal machinery you would not only organize the wrong people in  but you would organize the right people out ,1,val
1471,new york city is full of men whose passion for educating can find no vent in politics  because politics are corrupt  and who run civic leagues  night schools  lyceums  and people s institutes ,1,test

1473,all this zeal is at your disposal if you will only leave your office doors open and do something to deserve its support ,1,val
1474,do not adopt a scheme that excludes these men ,1,test

1479,i am ready to follow any one who wants to do this particular thing  that is  make an appeal to absolute unselfishness  at no point to conciliate any one ,1,train
1480, but this is anarchy  every man his own party   on the contrary  it is consolidation  for should two men arise  proposing this course  they would coalesce at once ,1,test
1481, but   you say   who is to do all the work ,1,val
1482,how are you to get men to come forward unless you give them tangible  formulated doctrines  papers to sign  and words to mumble   the answer is that the men who do the work in reform campaigns do not need these things ,1,train
1483,literature and doctrines you will undoubtedly produce ,1,train
1484,it is not necessary for the effective distribution of them  that you should adopt the parade of american party discipline ,1,val
1485,organization  head quarters  and a distribution of labor you must develop ,1,test

1488,where are your convention  your argument  your vote  your majority  your loyalty ,1,test

1490,as fast as they find themselves spiritually represented by some person or body  they follow that influence ,1,train
1491,it is representative government  but it represents only the positive and aspiring part of the community   the part which never gets represented under your system  because that system insists upon alloying it with other elements and ruining its power ,1,train
1492,it is educational activity in the purest form ,1,test
1493,by what other means can you speak to the whole people at once in the language of action ,1,train
1494,by what other means can you reach the conscience of the unknown man  who has not touched politics for twenty years because he could take no part in it  because he did not understand it   the disfranchised  scattered  and dumb men on whose voice the future waits ,1,val
1495,consider what you are trying to do ,1,train
1496,a party under control of a machine is held together by an appeal to self interest ,1,train
1497,its caucuses  affiliations  resources  methods are constructed on that principle ,1,train
1498,your body  whose aim is to increase the unselfishness and intellect of your fellow citizens  must be held together at every point by self sacrifice ,1,val

1521,this elaborate analysis of just how the force of feeling in yourself can best be used politically  is  after all  only an instance of a general law ,1,val
1522,the shortest path between two points always turns out to be a straight line ,1,train
1523,people who believe in the complexity of life  and have theories about crooked lines  want something else beside moral influence ,1,train

1536,the last illustration of this was given in roosevelt s campaign against van wyck in new york state ,1,train
1537,in this case  as generally happens  the real battle was fought in committee rooms before the forces were in the field ,1,train
1538,it was the struggle for position ,1,test

1540,the fight came over the minor offices ,1,train
1541,our new york form of ballot practically forces a man to vote for a  straight  ticket  and half a dozen independents put up a complete ticket with roosevelt at the head of it ,1,train
1542,their purpose was to prevent the republicans from using roosevelt s military popularity to sweep into office a lot of henchmen ,1,train
1543,within ten days the republican henchmen all over the state were taken with convulsions ,1,train
1544,every crank of the machine trembled ,1,train
1545,it turned its awful power upon roosevelt and ordered him to get off the independent ticket ,1,train
1546,he obeyed and protected the henchmen ,1,test
1547,the episode illustrates the practical power of a few independents who can act quickly ,1,train
1548,the panic in the republican camp was entirely justified ,1,train
1549,if three tickets had remained in the field with roosevelt at the head of two of them  thousands of democrats and thousands of republicans would have voted for the reform ticket ,1,train
1550,the republican ticket would have polled merely the dyed in the wool machine republicans ,1,test
1551,the rumpus among the republican heelers  following so slight a cause as the action of five or six citizens who took the field with a ticket of their own  resembled the action of a geyser when a cake of soap is thrown into it  rumbling  followed by terrific vomiting ,1,train
1552,a little practical discipline among the reformers is all that is required to make them formidable   the discipline of experience  of acting together  of personal trust ,1,train
1553,this is to be acquired only in the field of action ,1,train
1554,it is encouraging to find how small a body of men it takes  even at the present moment  to upset the calculations of the politicians ,1,test
1555,the force that made the republicans afraid did not lie in the parcel of men who threw in the soap ,1,test
1556,it came from the great public ,1,train
1557,the episode showed that the republicans were afraid to appeal to the country ,1,test
1558,they knew that their cabal was almost as much hated as tammany hall ,1,train
1559,there is always great difficulty in this world as to who shall bell the cat  but conventions of mice do not further the matter ,1,train
1560,the way to do it is for a parcel of mice to take their political lives in their hands and proceed to do it ,1,train
1561,                                   the real meaning of all these movements will not be perceived till their work has been done ,1,val
1562,as history  the cause and course of them will be so plain that a word will suffice to explain them ,1,test
1563,in the light of history it will be clear that the improvement in the personnel of our public life was due to the demands of the public  expressed in citizen s movements ,1,test
1564,we have already reached a point where neither party dares appeal to the public  as they did ten years ago  on purely party grounds ,1,val
1565,roosevelt and van wyck both claimed to be men superior to the average partisan ,1,test
1566,the advance of political thought has already made the dullest man perceive the machine within his own party  and every day spreads the news that there is only a single machine in all our politics ,1,val
1567,the destruction of this machine will not be like the destruction of the monasteries by henry viii   but it will consist in the substitution of new timber for old in the parties themselves ,1,train
1568,any one who looks for an expulsion of tammany hall like the expulsion of the moors from spain  will be disappointed ,1,train
1569,there will always be a tammany hall ,1,val
1570,but it will be run by respectable men  who will look back with wonder and disgust upon this period  and who will give the public an honest administration because the public has demanded it ,1,test
1571,ii  between elections   an election is like a flash of lightning at midnight ,1,train
1572,you get an instantaneous photograph of what every man is doing ,1,train
1573,you see his real relation toward his government ,1,train
1574,but an election happens only once a year ,1,train
1575,government goes on day and night ,1,train
1576,it is hard breaking down the popular fallacy that there is such a thing as  politics   governed by peculiar conditions  which must be understood and respected  that the whole thing is a mystic avocation  run as a trade by high priests and low priests  and is remote from our daily life ,1,test
1577,our system of party government has been developed with the aim of keeping the control in the hands of professionals ,1,train
1578,technicalities have been multiplied  and the rules of the game have become more and more complex ,1,train
1579,there exists  consequently  an unformulated belief that the corruption of politics is something by itself ,1,train
1580,yet there probably never was a civilization where the mesh of all powers and interests was so close ,1,test
1581,it is like the interlocking of roots in a swamp ,1,train
1582,such density and cohesion were never seen in any epoch  such a mat and tangle of personalities  where every man is tied up with the fibres of every other ,1,test
1583,if you take an axe or a saw  and cut a clean piece out of it anywhere  you will maim every member of society ,1,train
1584,how idle  then  even to think of politics as a subject by itself  or of the corruptions of the times as localized ,1,train
1585,politics gives what the chemists call a  mirror   and shows the ingredients in the average man s composition ,1,test
1586,but you must take your mind off politics if you want to understand america ,1,test
1587,you must take up the lives of individuals and follow them out  as they play against each other in counterpoint ,1,train
1588,as soon as you do this you will not be able to determine where politics begins and where it stops ,1,train
1589,it is all politics  it is all social intercourse  it is all business ,1,train

1594,it blows out the charge ,1,train
1595,we think that political agitation must show political results ,1,val
1596,this is like trying to alter the shape of a shadow without touching its object ,1,train
1597,the hope is not only mistaken  it is absurd ,1,train
1598,the results to be obtained from reform movements cannot show in the political field till they have passed through the social world ,1,test
1599, but  after all  what you want is votes  is it not    it would be so encouraging to see virtue win  that everybody would vote for you thereafter ,1,train
1600,why don t you manage it somehow   this sort of talk is the best record of incompetence which corruption has imprinted ,1,train
1601,enlighten this class and you have saved the republic ,1,train
1602,why  my friend  you are so lost  you are so much a mere product of tyranny that you do not know what a vote is ,1,train
1603,true  we want votes  but the votes we want must be cast spontaneously ,1,train
1604,we do not want them so badly as to buy them ,1,train
1605,a vote is only important because it is an opinion ,1,train
1606,even a dictator cannot force opinions upon his subjects by six months of rule  and yet the complaint is that decency gets few votes after a year of effort by a handful of radicals who are despised by the community ,1,train
1607,we only enter the field of politics because we can there get a hearing ,1,train
1608,the candidates in reform movements are tools ,1,train
1609,they are like crowbars that break open the mind of the age ,1,val
1610,they cannot be dodged  concealed  or laughed away ,1,train
1611,every one is aroused from his lethargy by seeing a real man walk on the scene  amid all the stage properties and marionettes of conventional politics ,1,test
1612, no fair   the people cry ,1,val
1613,they do not vote for him  of course  but they talk about the portent with a vigor no mere doctrine could call forth  and the discussion blossoms at a later date into a new public spirit  a new and genuine demand for better things ,1,train
1614,it is apparent that between the initial political activity of reformers and their ultimate political accomplishments  there must intervene the real agitation  the part that does the work  which goes on in the brains and souls of individual men  and which can only be observed in social life  in manners and conversation ,1,train
1615,now let us take up the steps by which  in practical life  the reaction is set going ,1,train
1616,enter the nearest coterie of radicals and listen to the quarrel ,1,train
1617,reformers proverbially disagree  and  their sects mince themselves almost to atoms   with us the quarrel always arises over the same point ,1,test
1618, can we afford  under these particular circumstances  to tell the exact truth   i have never known a reform movement in which this discussion did not rage from start to finish  nor have i known one where any other point was involved ,1,test
1619,you are a citizens  committee ,1,train
1620,the parties offer to give you half a loaf ,1,val
1621,well and good ,1,train
1622,but this is not their main object ,1,train
1623,they want you to call it a whole loaf ,1,test
1624,they want to dissipate your agitation by getting you to tell the public that you are satisfied ,1,test
1625,what they hate is the standard ,1,test
1626,the war between you and them is a spiritual game of chess ,1,train
1627,they must get you to say they are right ,1,train
1628,it is their only means of retaining their power ,1,train
1629,thus the apple of discord falls into the reform camp ,1,test
1630,half its members take the bait ,1,val
1631,in new york city our politics have been so picturesque  the pleas of the politician so shallow  the lies demanded from the reformers so obvious  that the eternal principles of the situation have been revealed in their elemental simplicity ,1,train
1632,it is just because the impulse towards better things carries no material content  we do not want any particular thing  but we want an improvement in everything  it is just because the whole movement is purely moral  that the same questions always arise ,1,test
1633,we ought not to grieve over the discussion  over the heart burn and heated argument that start from a knot of radicals and run through the community  setting men against each other ,1,train
1634,the quarrel in the executive committee of this reform body is the initiative of much wholesome life ,1,test
1635,they are no more responsible for it  they can no more avoid it  the community can no more advance to higher standards before they have had it  than a child can skate before it can walk ,1,train
1636,the executive committee is discussing the schools ,1,train
1637,in consequence of a recent agitation  the politicians have put up a candidate who will give new plumbing  even if he does steal the books  and the question is whether the school association shall indorse this candidate ,1,train
1638,if it does  he wins ,1,test
1639,if it does not  both plumbing and books are likely to remain the prey of the other party  and the lord knows how bad that is ,1,train
1640,the fight rages in the committee  and some sincere old gentleman is prophesying typhoid ,1,val
1641,the practical question is   do you want good plumbing  or do you want the truth   you cannot have both this year ,1,test
1642,if the association goes out and tells the public exactly what it knows  it will get itself laughed at  insult the candidate  and elect his opponent ,1,train
1643,if it tells the truth  it might as well run a candidate of its own as a protest and an advertisement of that truth ,1,test
1644,it can buy good plumbing with a lie  and the old gentleman thinks it ought to do so ,1,train
1645,the reformers are going to endorse the candidate  and upon their heads will be visited his theft of the books ,1,train
1646,they have sold out the little public confidence they held ,1,val
1647,had they stood out for another year  under the practical r gime which they had already endured for twenty  and had they devoted themselves to augmenting the public interest in the school question  both parties would have offered them plumbing and books to allay the excitement ,1,train
1648,the parties might  perhaps  have relaxed their grip on the whole school system rather than meet the issue ,1,train
1649,but the association does not understand this ,1,train
1650,it does not  as yet  clearly know its own mind ,1,train
1651,all this procedure  this going forward and back  is necessary ,1,train
1652,the community must pass through these experiences before it discovers that the shortest road to good schools is truth ,1,train
1653,a few men learn by each turn of the wheel  and these men tend to consolidate ,1,val
1654,they become a sort of school of political thought ,1,train
1655,they see that they do not care a whit more about the schools than they do about the parks  that the school agitation is a handy way to make the citizens take notice of maladministration in all departments  that the parties may be left to reform themselves  and to choose the most telling bid for popular favor  that the parties must do this and will do this  in so far as the public demands it  and will not do it under any other circumstances ,1,train
1656,it is the very greatest folly in the world for an agitator to be content with a partial success ,1,train
1657,it destroys his cause ,1,val
1658,he fades instantly ,1,train
1659,you cannot see him ,1,test
1660,he is become part of the corrupt and contented public ,1,train
1661,his business is to make others demand good administration ,1,test
1662,he must never reap  but always sow ,1,test
1663,let him leave the reaping to others ,1,val
1664,there will be many of them  and their material accomplishments will be the same whether he endorses them or not ,1,train
1665,if by chance some party  some administration gives him one hundred per cent of what he demands  let him acknowledge it handsomely  but he need not thank them ,1,test
1666,they did it because they had to  or because their conscience compelled them ,1,train
1667,in neither case was it done for him ,1,train
1668,in other words  reform is an idea that must be taken up as a whole ,1,train
1669,you do not want any specific thing ,1,train
1670,you use every issue as a symbol ,1,train
1671,let us give up the hope of finding any simpler way out of it ,1,train
1672,let us take up the burden at its heaviest end  and acknowledge that nothing but an increase of personal force in every american can change our politics ,1,test
1673,it is curious that this course  which is the shortest cut to the millennium  should be met with the reproach that it puts off victory ,1,train
1674,this is entirely due to a defect in the imagination of people who are dealing with an unfamiliar subject ,1,train
1675,we have to learn its principles ,1,train
1676,we know that what we really want is all of virtue  but it seems so unreasonable to claim this  that we try to buy it piecemeal   item  a schoolhouse  item  four parks  and with each gain comes a sacrifice of principle  disintegration  discouragement ,1,train
1677,fools  if you had asked for all  you would have had this and more ,1,val
1678,we are defeated by compromise because  no matter how much we may deceive ourselves into thinking that good government is an aggregate of laws and parks  it is not true ,1,train
1679,good government is the outcome of private virtue  and virtue is one thing   a unit  a force  a mode of motion ,1,train
1680,it cannot pass through a non conductor of casuistry at any point ,1,train
1681,compromise is loss  first  because it stops the movement  and kills energy  second  because it encourages the illusion that the wooden schoolhouse is good government ,1,train
1682,as against this  you have the fact that some hundreds of school children do get housed six months before they would have been housed otherwise ,1,train
1683,but this is like cashing a draft for a thousand pounds with a dish of oatmeal ,1,train
1684,we have  perhaps  followed in the wake of some little reform movement  and it has left us with an insight into the relation between private opinion and public occurrences ,1,test
1685,we have really found out two things  first  that in order to have better government  the talk and private intelligence upon which it rests must be going forward all the time  and second  that the individual conscience  intelligence  or private will is always set free by the same process   to wit  by the telling of truth ,1,test
1686,the identity between public and private life reveals itself the instant a man adopts the plan of indiscriminate truthtelling ,1,train
1687,he unmasks batteries and discloses wires at every dinner party  he sees practical politics in every law office  and social influence in every convention  and wherever he is  he suddenly finds himself  by his own will or against it  a centre of forces ,1,train
1688,let him blurt out his opinion ,1,train
1689,instantly there follows a little flash of reality ,1,train
1690,the shams drop  and the lines of human influence  the vital currents of energy  are disclosed ,1,train
1691,the only difference between a reform movement  so called  and the private act of any man who desires to better conditions  is that the private man sets one drawing room in a ferment by speaking his mind or by cutting his friend  and the agitator sets ten thousand in a ferment by attacking the age ,1,train
1692,as a practical matter  the conduct of politics depends upon the dinner table talk of men who are not in politics at all ,1,test
1693,government is carried on from moment to moment by the people ,1,train
1694,the executive is a mere hand and arm ,1,train

1697,if the governor is to set it up again  he must be sustained by the public ,1,train

1700,we do not ,1,train
1701,we are half hearted ,1,train
1702,to lend power to his hand we shall have to be strong men ,1,val
1703,if we now stood ready to denounce him for himself falling short by the breadth of a hair of his whole duty  our support  when we gave it  would be worth having ,1,test

1705,what did you find out at the last meeting of the library committee ,1,train
1706,you found out that commissioner hopkins s nephew was in the piano business  hence the commissioner s views on the music question ,1,test
1707,repeat it to the first man you meet in the street  and bring it up at the next meeting of the committee ,1,train
1708,you did not think you had much influence in town politics  and hardly knew how to step in ,1,train

1715,there is no way to study sociology but this ,1,test
1716,the books give no hint of what the science is like ,1,train
1717,they are written by men who do not know the world  but who go about gleaning information instead of trying experiments ,1,train
1718,the first discovery we make is that the worst enemy of good government is not our ignorant foreign voter  but our educated domestic railroad president  our prominent business man  our leading lawyer ,1,val
1719,if there is any truth in the optimistic belief that our standards are now going up  we shall soon see proofs of it in our homes ,1,test
1720,we shall not note our increase of virtue so much by seeing more crooks in sing sing  as by seeing fewer of them in the drawing rooms ,1,val
1721,you can acquire more knowledge of american politics by attacking  in open talk  a political lawyer of social standing  than you can in a year of study ,1,train
1722,these backstair men are in every bar association and every reform club ,1,train
1723,they are the agents who supervise the details of corruption ,1,train
1724,they run between the capitalist  the boss  and the public official ,1,val
1725,they know as fact what every one else knows as inference ,1,test
1726,they are the priestly class of commerce  and correspond to the intriguing ecclesiastics in periods of church ascendency ,1,train

1732,so long as such men enjoy public confidence we shall remain as we are ,1,test

1739,the general cowardice of this age covers itself with the illusion of charity  and asks  in the name of christ  that no one s feelings be hurt ,1,train

1928,you asked how to fight force ,1,train
1929,it must be fought with force  and not with arguments ,1,train
1930,indeed  it is easier to start a reform and carry it through  than it is to explain either why or how it is done ,1,test
1931,you can only understand this after you have been three times ridiculed as a reformer  and then you will begin to see that throughout the community  running through every one  there are currents of beneficent power that accomplish changes  sometimes visible  sometimes hard to see  that this power is in its nature quite as strong  quite as real and reliable  as that wall street current   terrible forces both of them  forever operative and struggling and contending together as they surge and swell through the people ,1,train

1936,you have a movement and an excitement over bad water  and it leaves you with kindergartens in your schools ,1,train
1937,it is this current that turns your remark at the club  which every one repeated in order to injure you  into a piece of encouragement to the banker s clerk  who could not have made it himself except at the cost of his livelihood ,1,train

1974,hence the great practical power of consistent radicals ,1,train
1975,to all appearance nobody follows them  yet every one believes them ,1,test
1976,they hold a tuning fork and sound a  and everybody knows it really is a  though the time honored pitch is g flat ,1,train
1977,the community cannot get that a out of its head ,1,train
1978,nothing can prevent an upward tendency in the popular tone so long as the real a is kept sounding ,1,train
1979,every now and then the whole town strikes it for a week  and all the bells ring  and then all sinks to suppressed discord and denial ,1,train
1980,the reason why we have not  of late years  had strong consistent centres of influence  focuses of steady political power  has been that the community has not developed men who could hold the note ,1,train
1981,it was only when the note made a temporary concord with some heavy political scheme that the reform leaders could hear it themselves ,1,val
1982,for the rest of the time it threw the whole civilization out of tune ,1,val
1983,the terrible clash of interests drowned it ,1,train
1984,the reformers themselves lost it  and wandered up and down  guessing ,1,train
1985,it is imagined that nature goes by jumps  and that a whole community can suddenly sing in tune  after it has been caterwauling and murdering the scale for twenty years ,1,train
1986,the truth is  we ought to thank god when any man or body of men make the discovery that there is such a thing as absolute pitch  or absolute honesty  or absolute personal and intellectual integrity ,1,train
1987,a few years of this spirit will identify certain men with the fundamental idea that truth is stronger than consequences  and these men will become the most serious force and the only truly political force in their community ,1,test
1988,their ambition is illimitable  for you cannot set bounds to personal influence ,1,val
1989,but it is an ambition that cannot be abused ,1,val
1990,a departure from their own course will ruin any one of them in a night  and undo twenty years of service ,1,test
1991,it would be natural that such sets of men should arise all over the country  men who  wanted  nothing  and should reveal the inverse position of the boss system  a set of moral bosses with no organizations  no politics  men thrown into prominence by the operation of all the forces of human nature now suppressed  and the suppression of those now operative ,1,train
1992,it is obvious that one such man will suffice for a town ,1,train
1993,in the competition of character  one man will be naturally fixed upon  whom his competitors will be the first to honor  and upon him will be condensed the public feeling  the confidence of the community ,1,val
1994,if the extreme case do not arise  nevertheless it is certain that the tendencies toward a destruction of the present system  will reveal themselves as a tendency making for the weight of personal character in practical politics ,1,train
1995,reform politics is  after all  a simple thing ,1,test
1996,it demands no great attainments ,1,train
1997,you can play the game in the dark ,1,train

2005,why is it that if you go down to the bowery and set up a kindergarten or give a course of lectures on the duties of citizenship  every one commends you  whereas if you go into some abandoned district where a tammany thug is running for the state assembly against a republican heeler  and if you put an honest man in the field against them both  your friends call you a fool  and say that your reform consists of mere negation ,1,val
2006,who asks to see the results upon the public welfare of a night school in astronomy ,1,train
2007,yet  if you get ten mechanics to labor for six months with the fire of enthusiasm in them  building up a radical club  and as a result  one hundred and fifty men cast for the first time in their lives a vote that represents the heart and conscience of each  your intelligent friends ask   what have you done ,1,train
2008,you are howling against the moon    why is it that if you are a grocer and refuse to sand your sugar  you are called honest ,1,train
2009,yet  if a young politician takes this course  it is supposed that life is not long enough for the world to discover his value  he is a visionary ,1,train
2010,in the sugar trade  the man insisted upon dealing with the community as a whole ,1,test
2011,he was not trying to sell sugar to a club  or to benefit some district ,1,train
2012,he dealt with the public ,1,test
2013,now  if a politician deals directly with the public  we condemn him because we cannot see the empire of confidence he is building up ,1,train
2014,the reason we do not see it is entirely due to historical causes ,1,train
2015,we have had little experience recently in the utility of large appeals ,1,train
2016,we forget their power ,1,val
2017,yet we are not without examples ,1,val
2018,grover cleveland dealt directly with the people on a great scale ,1,train
2019,he established a personal relation that was stronger than party bonds ,1,train
2020,this made him president  preserved his character and gave reality to politics ,1,train
2021,it was a bit of education to every man in the united states to see what riff raff our political arks were made of  a man laid his hand on the end of one of them and tore off the roof ,1,train
2022,we are rather more familiar with the power of public confidence as seen in times of revolution ,1,train
2023,in the year of the lexow investigation the people of new york city believed that dr  parkhurst and john goff were in earnest ,1,val
2024,there was a period of a few weeks when goff exercised the powers of a dictator ,1,train

2028,the revelations of the summer had awakened the spirit of revolt in the masses of the people  and it expressed itself directly as power ,1,test
2029,the machinery of government was not in abeyance  but it was seen to be a mere vehicle ,1,val
2030,it could be made to work justice ,1,val
2031,here were two men  goff and parkhurst  rendered all powerful by the existence of popular confidence ,1,train
2032,the state of mind of the community was unusual  and the indignation soon subsided  but it subsided to a new level  and the abuses and inhumanity of boss tyranny have never since been so severe in new york ,1,train
2033,our people have seen several volcanic eruptions of this sort  and therefore they believe in them ,1,train
2034,they believe in the moral power of the community  but are afraid it can only act by convulsion ,1,test
2035,they think that some new principle comes into play at such times  something which is not a constant factor in daily government ,1,val
2036,on the other hand  we have all been trained to respect plodding methods in common education  and we know that much can be done by kindergartens  boys  clubs  and propaganda to change the standards of the community and make men trust virtue ,1,train
2037,we believe in the boys  club  and we believe in the earthquake  we forget that the same principle underlies them both ,1,val
2038,when some one applies this principle to the field of political education that lies between them  we are cynical because we have no experience ,1,train
2039,apart from the lack of experience that prevents people from seeing the use of this practical activity  there are two distressing elements that make men not want to see it ,1,test
2040,in the first place  even if you work in the bowery and a friend votes in harlem  you are apt to be hitting his interests and prejudices ,1,train
2041,and in the second place your conduct is a horrid appeal ,1,train

2044,the real distinction between this particular sort of work and other philanthropy is  that other philanthropy is preparatory drill  this is war ,1,train
2045,the other is feeding  training  and preaching  this is practice ,1,train
2046,now  you may have your license to preach all you please in the vineyard  but if you touch the soil with the spade  you find the ground is pre empted  you are fighting a railroad ,1,train

2048,in lecturing before the university extension in pennsylvania  you are not allowed to talk politics ,1,test
2049,it is against the policy of the philanthropists who run the institution  and who are run by the railroad ,1,train
2050,the situation in philadelphia is merely illustrative of the distinction between philanthropy and political reform  which is always ready to become apparent ,1,train
2051,of course  so long as the railroad distributes the philanthropy  there will result nothing but tyranny ,1,train
2052,the roman emperors gave shows to amuse the people  and we give them talks on botticelli and magic lantern pictures of the nile ,1,train
2053,there are  then  real reasons why our people are slow to acknowledge the utility of militant political reform  and why they clutch at any handle against it ,1,train
2054,but we have much more to learn from the philanthropists by a study of what they have done than by dwelling on their shortcomings ,1,val
2055,they have labored while the political reformers have slept  and after many trials and many failures they have found certain working principles ,1,train
2056,it was they who discovered that we cannot  as human nature is constituted  give strength to any one except by helping the whole man to develop at once ,1,test
2057,we must give him a chance to grow ,1,test
2058,the workers among the poor have long ago seen the futility of any effort except that of raising the general standards of living ,1,val
2059,they have established settlements  where the relation between the settlers and the surrounding population is as natural as family life and as perennial as tammany hall ,1,train
2060,after ten years of experiment this has been done in many places ,1,train
2061,if you will go to one of these places and study exactly what has happened in the line of benefit to the people  you will see that it has resulted  wholly  from personal influence   that is to say  from the effect of character upon character ,1,test
2062, two years ago we established a boys  club  and soon afterwards a kindergarten ,1,train
2063,the boys returned one day  and out of jealousy smashed everything belonging to the kindergarten  and piled the rubbish in the middle of the room ,1,test
2064,last week a barrel of fruit was sent here for the sick and weakly  and we left the barrel open with a card on the outside to that effect ,1,train
2065,you could not get the boys to touch the fruit ,1,train
2066,now  if you ask me what system or what part of the system has caused the change in these boys  i don t know    this is reform politics  but unless you and i go there and make a place for these boys in practical politics  they will find waiting for them nothing but the caucus and the job ,1,test
2067,they will relapse and forget ,1,train
2068,it is throwing effort into the sea to train the young if you stop there ,1,train
2069,the test comes when the scaffoldings of early life are taken down ,1,train
2070,each man meets the world alone ,1,val
2071,the tragedies of character occur at this period ,1,train

2073,so far as the hope of political purity goes  there are acres of this city that are in a worse condition than health was in before the era of hospitals ,1,train
2074,fly over them as the crow flies  and you cannot find a centre of downright antagonism to evil ,1,test
2075,the population does not know that such a thing exists  and yet  if you propose to go there and set up a fight against both parties   that is to say  a fight against wickedness   you are told by patriots and doctors of divinity   don t do it unless you can win ,1,train
2076,you will disgust people with reform    it is awful and at the same time ludicrous to hear an educated person maintain this doctrine and in the same breath mourn over the corruption of the masses ,1,train
2077,the man throws his own dark shadow over them and bewails their want of light ,1,train
2078,he doubts the power of personal influence  and yet there is absolutely no other force for good in the world  and never has been ,1,train
2079,let us stick to facts ,1,train
2080,take individual cases of improvement and see what power has been at work ,1,train
2081,you will find that you disclose behind any personal improvement  not a ballot law or an organization  but a human being ,1,train
2082,the movement for political reform goes into the bowery in the wake of the philanthropists ,1,train
2083,we go there knowing something about practical politics ,1,test
2084,we know  for instance  that the bowery is the geographical name for a district which is really governed by the same forces as fifth avenue ,1,train
2085,to think that the politics of the bowery are controlled by the bowery is about as sensible as to believe that the politics of irkutsk are controlled at irkutsk ,1,train
2086,we have got  first  to disclose the machinery of evil and then to fight it wherever we find it  even though it lead us into churches ,1,val
2087,nothing is needed in any tammany club on the bowery that is not needed ten times as much in the union league club on fifth avenue  personal self sacrifice for principle in a cause which is apparently hopeless ,1,train
2088,unless you go there displaying that  you are not needed ,1,train
2089,our intercourse with the laboring man is a great teacher to ourselves ,1,train
2090,that is its main use ,1,test
2091,it brings out  as nothing else can  the magnitude and perfection of the system  whose visible top and little flag we can always see  but whose dimensions and ramifications nothing but experiment can reveal  philosophy could not guess it ,1,train
2092,here is a laborer on the street railroad ,1,val
2093,in order to get work he must show a ticket from the party boss ,1,train

2095,here is a young notary whom you employ to carry about the certificate that puts an independent candidate in nomination ,1,val
2096,you try to get him to sign the thing himself and join your club ,1,test
2097,it is no use asking ,1,test
2098,his brother did it once and lost his place  so close is the scrutiny  so rapid the punishment ,1,train
2099,examine the retail grocer  or the tobacconist  or the cobbler  go into particulars with him  and you will find that his unwillingness to join your movement does not spring so directly from his inability to see the point of it  as from fear of the direct and immediate consequences to himself ,1,train
2100,we wanted to elevate the masses  but it turns out  as the philanthropists discerned long ago  that there are no masses in america  there are no masses in new york city ,1,val
2101,we can discover only individuals  who are each controlled by individual interests  by various and subtle considerations ,1,train
2102,these men are in chains to other men  who often live in other parts of the city ,1,train
2103,the attorneys and merchants  the business world in fact  is found to be in league with abuse ,1,train

2105,he built the yacht club  is vestryman in the biggest church  and is revered by all men ,1,val
2106,the title deeds and registry books of all visible wealth  show the names of his intimate friends ,1,train
2107,all we can do in the way of weakening the chains is to expose them  this cruelty is largely ignorance ,1,train
2108,the beneficiaries must be made to see the sources of their wealth ,1,train

2110,the american business man is a warm hearted being ,1,train
2111,he does not even care for money  but for the game of business ,1,test
2112,as matters now stand in america  we see this condition   that it is for the immediate interest of the dominant class  namely  the politico financial class  to keep the people as selfish as possible ,1,test
2113,we have examined the subtle strains of influence and prejudice by which this commercial interest has been extended  until  as a practical matter  it is almost impossible for a man to get word to the laboring classes that there exists such a thing as political morality ,1,train
2114,some professional philanthropist always stands ready to prevent the signal of honesty from being raised  some set of sunday citizens interposes to stop the unwise  inexpedient  foolhardy attempt to be independent of rascality ,1,val
2115,and when you do succeed in reaching the mechanic  what can you do for him ,1,train
2116,tell him to be a man  and strike off the shackles that bind him ,1,train
2117,here we are  as helpless before the poor as before the rich  facing both of them with the same query   can you not see that your own concession  call it poverty  or call it poverty of will  is one element of this oppression    the difference between the poor and the financial classes is one of spiritual complexity ,1,test
2118,the promoters are well to do because their minds have been able to grasp and utilize the complex forces made up of the minds of their simpler fellow beings ,1,val
2119,and this astuteness leaves them less open to unselfish emotions than the laboring man ,1,train
2120,his nature is more intact ,1,test
2121,he is a more emotional and instinctive being ,1,train
2122,it is for this reason that moral reforms have come from the lower strata of society ,1,train
2123,the people have as much to lose as the bankers  but they are more ready to lose it ,1,train
2124,the head of moral feeling in the community has got to grow strong enough to force the financier to take his clutch off the laboring man  before you can reach the laboring man ,1,test
2125,and yet labor itself will contribute more than its share towards this head of moral feeling  and therefore you must go among the laboring classes with your ideas and your propaganda ,1,train
2126,but beware lest you give him a stone for bread ,1,train
2127,you can do no more for a man because you call yourself a  politician  than if you were a mere philanthropist ,1,train
2128,a man s standards of political thought are but a small fraction of his general standards  and unless your sense of truth is as sharp as a sword you had better not come near the laboring man ,1,val
2129,the point here made is  and it is of great importance  that we candidly acknowledge at every instant the nature of our undertaking and the nature of our power  for in so far as we mistake them we weaken our practical utility ,1,test
2130,it is not as the agent of any institution that you are here  but as the agent of conscience at the dictation of personal feeling ,1,train
2131,do you need proof that you yourself draw all your power from sheer moral influence ,1,train
2132,note what you do when you start your club ,1,test

2158,as a practical matter  every one does employ the whole of it every time he even thinks of reform ,1,test
2159,now  just as we can trace the sources of our power in the great currents of human feeling that flow down to us out of the past  so we can foresee the accomplishments of that power in enlarging the lives of men who come after us ,1,test

2242,the subject includes more than the daily newspapers ,1,train
2243,those ephemeral sheets that flutter from the table into the waste paper basket  which are something more than mere newspapers and less than magazines  and the magazines themselves  which are more than budgets of gossip and less than books  make up a perpetual rain of paper and ink ,1,val

2245,this whole species of literature is typical of the age  let us see how it is conducted ,1,train
2246,a journal is a meeting place between the forces of intellect and of commerce ,1,train
2247,the men who become editors always bear some relation to the intellectual interests of the country ,1,train
2248,they make money  but they make it by understanding the minds of people who are not taking money  but thought  from the exchanges that the editors set up ,1,train
2249,a magazine or a newspaper is a shop ,1,train

2252,the one thing a journal must have in order to be a journal is circulation ,1,test
2253,it must be carried into people s houses  and this is brought about by an impulse in the buyer ,1,val
2254,the buyer has many opinions and modes of thought that he does not draw from the journal  and he is always ready to drop a journal that offends him ,1,test
2255,an editor is thus constantly forced to choose between affronting his public and placating his public ,1,train
2256,now  whatever arguments may be given for his taking one course or the other  it remains clear that in so far as an editor is not publishing what he himself thinks of interest for its own sake  he is encouraging in the public something else besides intellect ,1,train
2257,he is subserving financial  political  or religious bias  or  it may be  popular whim ,1,val
2258,he is  to this extent at least  the custodian and protector of prejudice ,1,train
2259,the thrift of an editor owner  who is building up the circulation of a paper  tends to keep him conservative ,1,train
2260,repetition is safer than innovation ,1,train

2262,there is money to be made by any one who discerns a new way of reinforcing any prejudice of the american people ,1,test
2263,it has come about very naturally during the last thirty years  that journalism has been developed in america as one of the branches in the science of catering to the masses on a gigantic scale ,1,test
2264,the different kinds of conservatism have been banked  consolidated  and  as it were  marshalled under the banners of as many journals ,1,train
2265,money and energy have been expended in collecting these vast audiences  and sleepless vigilance is needed to keep them together ,1,test
2266,the great investments in the good will of millions are nursed by editors who live by their talents  and who in another age would have been intellectual men ,1,val
2267,the highest type of editor now extant in america will as frankly regret his own obligation to cater to mediocrity  as the business man will regret his obligation to pay blackmail  or as the citizen will regret his obligation to vote for one of the parties ,1,train

2269,i am dealing with the money of others ,1,train
2270,there are not enough intelligent people to count   he serves the times ,1,test
2271,the influence thus exerted by the public  through the editor  upon the writer tends to modify the writer and make him resemble the public ,1,train
2272,it is a spiritual pressure exerted by the majority in favor of conformity ,1,train
2273,this exists in all countries  but is peculiarly severe in countries and ages where the majority is made up of individuals very similar to each other ,1,train
2274,the tyranny of a uniform population always makes itself felt ,1,test

2333,you cannot buy and sell it without turning it into something else ,1,val
2334,the exercise of that infinitesimal fraction of public power represented by one man s vote is hedged about with penalties  because the logic of practical government has forced us to see its importance ,1,train
2335,but the harm done to a community by the sale of a vote does not follow by virtue of the statute  but by virtue of a law of influence of which the statute is the recognition ,1,train

2363,there is a misconception in this wholesale appropriation of a partial truth ,1,train
2364,the economic laws are valuable and suggestive  but they are founded on the belief that a man will pursue his own business interests exclusively ,1,train
2365,this is never entirely true even in trade  and the doctrines of the economists become more and more misleading when applied to fields of life where the money motive becomes incidental ,1,train
2366,the law of supply and demand does not govern the production of sonnets ,1,train

3045,the invisible waves of force which do as a matter of fact rule the world  using its fictions and its phrases as mere transmitting plates  strike keenly upon the heart of the youth  and the vibrations of instinctive passion that shake his frame are the response of a strong creature to the laws of its universe ,1,train
3046,this unlearned knowledge of good and evil is like the response of the eyes to light or of the tongue to the taste of a fruit ,1,train
3047,it was not indoctrinated  it is a reaction to a stimulus ,1,train
3048,so long as the world shall last  men will be writing books in order to explain and justify the instincts  inventing theologies and ethical codes  and projecting political programs to advance and confirm them ,1,val

3058,the anecdotes and fables of the world  its drama  its poetry and fiction  its religion and piety  its domestic teaching and its monuments support this instinct  and describe the same figure ,1,train
3059,further still  there is not a man who does not reveal it in his soul s anatomy  so much so that upon every occasion except where his interests are touched  he is for virtue  and even where they are touched  it is only a question of a few degrees more heat to dissolve the habits and prejudices of a lifetime  and make him take off his coat and go into a war or a political campaign ,1,val
3060,a single man  as we see him in one of the great modern civilizations  looks like a bit of machinery  a cog or a crank or an air brake ,1,train

3228, oh  my dear mr  bennet   as she entered the room   we have had a       most delightful evening  a most excellent ball ,2,test
3229,i wish you had       been there ,2,train
3230,jane was so admired  nothing could be like it ,2,train
3231,everybody said how well she looked  and mr  bingley thought her       quite beautiful  and danced with her twice ,2,val
3232,only think of  that         my dear  he actually danced with her twice  and she was the only       creature in the room that he asked a second time ,2,val
3233,first of all        he asked miss lucas ,2,train
3234,i was so vexed to see him stand up with her        but  however  he did not admire her at all  indeed  nobody can        you know  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going       down the dance ,2,train
3235,so he enquired who she was  and got introduced        and asked her for the two next ,2,val
3236,then  the two third he danced with       miss king  and the two fourth with maria lucas  and the two fifth       with jane again  and the two sixth with lizzy  and the        boulanger            if he had had any compassion for  me    cried her husband       impatiently   he would not have danced half so much ,2,val
3237,for god s       sake  say no more of his partners ,2,test
3238,oh that he had sprained his       ankle in the first dance           oh ,2,train
3239,my dear   continued mrs  bennet   i am quite delighted with him ,2,test

3243,i dare say the lace       upon mrs  hurst s gown          here she was interrupted again ,2,val
3244,mr  bennet protested against any       description of finery ,2,train
3245,she was therefore obliged to seek another       branch of the subject  and related  with much bitterness of       spirit and some exaggeration  the shocking rudeness of mr  darcy ,2,val
3246, but i can assure you   she added   that lizzy does not lose much       by not suiting  his  fancy  for he is a most disagreeable  horrid       man  not at all worth pleasing ,2,train
3247,so high and so conceited that       there was no enduring him ,2,train
3248,he walked here  and he walked there        fancying himself so very great ,2,train
3249,not handsome enough to dance       with ,2,train
3250,i wish you had been there  my dear  to have given him one       of your set downs ,2,train
3251,i quite detest the man       chapter          when jane and elizabeth were alone  the former  who had been       cautious in her praise of mr  bingley before  expressed to her       sister how very much she admired him ,2,train
3252, he is just what a young man ought to be   said she   sensible        good humoured  lively  and i never saw such happy manners  so       much ease  with such perfect good breeding           he is also handsome   replied elizabeth   which a young man       ought likewise to be  if he possibly can ,2,train
3253,his character is       thereby complete           i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second       time ,2,train
3254,i did not expect such a compliment           did not you ,2,train
3255, i  did for you ,2,val
3256,but that is one great difference       between us ,2,train
3257,compliments always take  you  by surprise  and  me        never ,2,val
3258,what could be more natural than his asking you again ,2,val
3259,he       could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as       every other woman in the room ,2,train
3260,no thanks to his gallantry for       that ,2,train
3261,well  he certainly is very agreeable  and i give you leave       to like him ,2,train
3262,you have liked many a stupider person           dear lizzy           oh ,2,train
3263,you are a great deal too apt  you know  to like people in       general ,2,test
3264,you never see a fault in anybody ,2,train
3265,all the world are good       and agreeable in your eyes ,2,train
3266,i never heard you speak ill of a       human being in my life           i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one  but i always       speak what i think           i know you do  and it is  that  which makes the wonder ,2,val
3267,with        your  good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and       nonsense of others ,2,train
3268,affectation of candour is common enough  one       meets with it everywhere ,2,test
3269,but to be candid without ostentation or       design to take the good of everybody s character and make it       still better  and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone ,2,train
3270,and so  you like this man s sisters  too  do you ,2,train
3271,their manners       are not equal to his           certainly not  at first ,2,val
3272,but they are very pleasing women when       you converse with them ,2,test
3273,miss bingley is to live with her brother        and keep his house  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a       very charming neighbour in her          elizabeth listened in silence  but was not convinced  their       behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in       general  and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy       of temper than her sister  and with a judgment too unassailed by       any attention to herself  she was very little disposed to approve       them ,2,train
3274,they were in fact very fine ladies  not deficient in good       humour when they were pleased  nor in the power of       being agreeable where they chose it  but proud and conceited ,2,train
3275,they were rather handsome  had been educated in one of the first       private seminaries in town  had a fortune of twenty thousand       pounds  were in the habit of spending more than they ought  and       of associating with people of rank  and were therefore in every       respect entitled to think well of themselves  and meanly of       others ,2,train
3276,they were of a respectable family in the north of       england  a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories       than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired       by trade ,2,train
3277,mr  bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred       thousand pounds from his father  who had intended to purchase an       estate  but did not live to do it ,2,val
3278,mr  bingley intended it       likewise  and sometimes made choice of his county  but as he was       now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor  it was       doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his       temper  whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at       netherfield  and leave the next generation to purchase ,2,train
3279,his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own        but though he was now established only as a tenant  miss bingley       was by no means unwilling to preside at his table  nor was mrs        hurst  who had married a man of more fashion than fortune  less       disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her ,2,test
3280,mr  bingley had not been of age two years  when he was tempted by       an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house ,2,test
3281,he did       look at it  and into it for half an hour  was pleased with the       situation and the principal rooms  satisfied with what the owner       said in its praise  and took it immediately ,2,val
3282,between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship  in       spite of great opposition of character ,2,train
3283,bingley was endeared to       darcy by the easiness  openness  and ductility of his temper        though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own        and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied ,2,train
3284,on the       strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance  and       of his judgment the highest opinion ,2,train
3285,in understanding  darcy was       the superior ,2,val
3286,bingley was by no means deficient  but darcy was       clever ,2,train
3287,he was at the same time haughty  reserved  and       fastidious  and his manners  though well bred  were not inviting ,2,test
3288,in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage ,2,train
3289,bingley was       sure of being liked wherever he appeared  darcy was continually       giving offence ,2,train
3290,the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was       sufficiently characteristic ,2,val
3291,bingley had never met with       pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life  everybody had been       most kind and attentive to him  there had been no formality  no       stiffness  he had soon felt acquainted with all the room  and as       to miss bennet  he could not conceive an angel more beautiful ,2,test
3292,darcy  on the contrary  had seen a collection of people in whom       there was little beauty and no fashion  for none of whom he had       felt the smallest interest  and from none received either       attention or pleasure ,2,train
3293,miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty        but she smiled too much ,2,test
3294,mrs  hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they       admired her and liked her  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl        and one whom they should not object to know more of ,2,train
3295,miss bennet       was therefore established as a sweet girl  and their brother felt       authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose ,2,train
3296,chapter          within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the       bennets were particularly intimate ,2,train
3297,sir william lucas had been       formerly in trade in meryton  where he had made a tolerable       fortune  and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to       the king during his mayoralty ,2,train
3298,the distinction had perhaps been       felt too strongly ,2,train
3299,it had given him a disgust to his business       and to his residence in a small market town  and  quitting       them both  he had removed with his family to a house about a mile       from meryton  denominated from that period lucas lodge  where he       could think with pleasure of his own importance  and  unshackled       by business  occupy himself solely in being civil to all the       world ,2,test
3300,for  though elated by his rank  it did not render him       supercilious  on the contrary  he was all attention to everybody ,2,train
3301,by nature inoffensive  friendly  and obliging  his presentation       at st  james s had made him courteous ,2,train
3302,lady lucas was a very good kind of woman  not too clever to be a       valuable neighbour to mrs  bennet ,2,train
3303,they had several children ,2,train
3304,the       eldest of them  a sensible  intelligent young woman  about       twenty seven  was elizabeth s intimate friend ,2,test
3305,that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk       over a ball was absolutely necessary  and the morning after the       assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to       communicate ,2,train
3306,  you  began the evening well  charlotte   said mrs  bennet with       civil self command to miss lucas ,2,test
3307,  you  were mr  bingley s first       choice           yes  but he seemed to like his second better           oh ,2,test
3308,you mean jane  i suppose  because he danced with her twice ,2,val
3309,to be sure that  did  seem as if he admired her indeed i rather       believe he  did  i heard something about it but i hardly know       what something about mr  robinson           perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr  robinson        did not i mention it to you ,2,train
3310,mr  robinson s asking him how he       liked our meryton assemblies  and whether he did not think there       were a great many pretty women in the room  and  which  he       thought the prettiest ,2,test
3311,and his answering immediately to the last       question  oh ,2,train
3312,the eldest miss bennet  beyond a doubt  there       cannot be two opinions on that point            upon my word ,2,test
3313,well  that was very decided indeed that does seem       as if but  however  it may all come to nothing  you know            my  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours   eliza         said charlotte ,2,train
3314, mr ,2,val
3315,darcy is not so well worth listening to as       his friend  is he  poor eliza  to be only just  tolerable            i beg you would not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his       ill treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man that it would       be quite a misfortune to be liked by him ,2,val
3316,mrs  long told me last       night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once       opening his lips           are you quite sure  ma am  is not there a little mistake   said       jane ,2,val
3317, i certainly saw mr  darcy speaking to her           aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield  and       he could not help answering her  but she said he seemed very       angry at being spoke to           miss bingley told me   said jane   that he never speaks much       unless among his intimate acquaintance ,2,train
3318,with  them  he is       remarkably agreeable           i do not believe a word of it  my dear ,2,train
3319,if he had been so very       agreeable  he would have talked to mrs  long ,2,train
3320,but i can guess how       it was  everybody says that he is eat up with pride  and i dare       say he had heard somehow that mrs  long does not keep a carriage        and had come to the ball in a hack chaise           i do not mind his not talking to mrs  long   said miss lucas         but i wish he had danced with eliza           another time  lizzy   said her mother   i would not dance with        him   if i were you           i believe  ma am  i may safely promise you  never  to dance with       him           his pride   said miss lucas   does not offend  me  so much as       pride often does  because there is an excuse for it ,2,train
3321,one cannot       wonder that so very fine a young man  with family  fortune        everything in his favour  should think highly of himself ,2,train
3322,if i       may so express it  he has a  right  to be proud           that is very true   replied elizabeth   and i could easily       forgive  his  pride  if he had not mortified  mine            pride   observed mary  who piqued herself upon the solidity of       her reflections   is a very common failing  i believe ,2,train
3323,by all       that i have ever read  i am convinced that it is very common       indeed  that human nature is particularly prone to it  and that       there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of       self complacency on the score of some quality or other  real or       imaginary ,2,train
3324,vanity and pride are different things  though the       words are often used synonymously ,2,train
3325,a person may be proud without       being vain ,2,train
3326,pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves        vanity to what we would have others think of us           if i were as rich as mr  darcy   cried a young lucas  who came       with his sisters   i should not care how proud i was ,2,train
3327,i would       keep a pack of foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine every day           then you would drink a great deal more than you ought   said       mrs  bennet   and if i were to see you at it  i should take away       your bottle directly          the boy protested that she should not  she continued to declare       that she would  and the argument ended only with the visit ,2,train
3328,chapter          the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield ,2,train
3329,the       visit was returned in due form ,2,test
3330,miss bennet s pleasing       manners grew on the goodwill of mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and       though the mother was found to be intolerable  and the younger       sisters not worth speaking to  a wish of being better acquainted       with  them  was expressed towards the two eldest ,2,test
3331,by jane this       attention was received with the greatest pleasure  but elizabeth       still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody        hardly excepting even her sister  and could not like them  though       their kindness to jane  such as it was  had a value as arising in       all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration ,2,train
3332,it was generally evident whenever they met  that he  did  admire       her  and to  her  it was equally evident that jane was yielding to       the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the       first  and was in a way to be very much in love  but she       considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered       by the world in general  since jane united with great strength       of feeling  a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of       manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the       impertinent ,2,val
3333,she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas ,2,train
3334, it may perhaps be pleasant   replied charlotte   to be able to       impose on the public in such a case  but it is sometimes a       disadvantage to be so very guarded ,2,test
3335,if a woman conceals her       affection with the same skill from the object of it  she may lose       the opportunity of fixing him  and it will then be but poor       consolation to believe the world equally in the dark ,2,train
3336,there is so       much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment  that it       is not safe to leave any to itself ,2,val
3337,we can all  begin  freely a       slight preference is natural enough  but there are very few of us       who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement ,2,train
3338,in nine cases out of ten  a woman had better show  more  affection       than she feels ,2,train
3339,bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  but he may       never do more than like her  if she does not help him on           but she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow ,2,test
3340,if        i  can perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton       indeed not to discover it too           remember  eliza  that he does not know jane s disposition as you       do           but if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to       conceal it  he must find it out           perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her ,2,val
3341,but though bingley       and jane meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours       together  and as they always see each other in large mixed       parties  it is impossible that every moment should be employed in       conversing together ,2,train
3342,jane should therefore make the most of every       half hour in which she can command his attention ,2,test
3343,when she is       secure of him  there will be leisure for falling in love as       much as she chooses           your plan is a good one   replied elizabeth   where nothing is       in question but the desire of being well married  and if i were       determined to get a rich husband  or any husband  i dare say i       should adopt it ,2,train
3344,but these are not jane s feelings  she is not       acting by design ,2,train
3345,as yet  she cannot even be certain of the       degree of her own regard  nor of its reasonableness ,2,train
3346,she has known       him only a fortnight ,2,train
3347,she danced four dances with him at meryton        she saw him one morning at his own house  and has since dined       in company with him four times ,2,test
3348,this is not quite enough to make       her understand his character           not as you represent it ,2,train
3349,had she merely  dined  with him  she       might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite  but       you must remember that four evenings have been also spent       together and four evenings may do a great deal           yes  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that       they both like vingt un better than commerce  but with respect to       any other leading characteristic  i do not imagine that much has       been unfolded           well   said charlotte   i wish jane success with all my heart        and if she were married to him to morrow  i should think she had       as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his       character for a twelvemonth ,2,train
3350,happiness in marriage is entirely a       matter of chance ,2,train
3351,if the dispositions of the parties are ever so       well known to each other  or ever so similar beforehand  it does       not advance their felicity in the least ,2,train
3352,they always continue to       grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of       vexation  and it is better to know as little as possible of the       defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life           you make me laugh  charlotte  but it is not sound ,2,val
3353,you know it       is not sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself          occupied in observing mr  bingley s attentions to her sister        elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming       an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend ,2,train
3354,mr  darcy       had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty  he had looked at       her without admiration at the ball  and when they next met  he       looked at her only to criticise ,2,train
3355,but no sooner had he made it       clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good       feature in her face  than he began to find it was rendered       uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark       eyes ,2,train
3356,to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying ,2,train
3357,though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure       of perfect symmetry in her form  he was forced to acknowledge her       figure to be light and pleasing  and in spite of his asserting       that her manners were not those of the fashionable world  he was       caught by their easy playfulness ,2,val
3358,of this she was perfectly       unaware  to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable       nowhere  and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance       with ,2,val
3359,he began to wish to know more of her  and as a step towards       conversing with her himself  attended to her conversation with       others ,2,test
3360,his doing so drew her notice ,2,val

3395,chapter          mr  bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of       two thousand a year  which  unfortunately for his daughters  was       entailed  in default of heirs male  on a distant relation  and       their mother s fortune  though ample for her situation in life        could but ill supply the deficiency of his ,2,train

3398,the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton  a most       convenient distance for the young ladies  who were usually       tempted thither three or four times a week  to pay their duty to       their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way ,2,train
3399,the two       youngest of the family  catherine and lydia  were particularly       frequent in these attentions  their minds were more vacant than       their sisters   and when nothing better offered  a walk to       meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish       conversation for the evening  and however bare of news the       country in general might be  they always contrived to learn some       from their aunt ,2,train
3400,at present  indeed  they were well supplied both       with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia       regiment in the neighbourhood  it was to remain the whole winter        and meryton was the headquarters ,2,train

3405,they       could talk of nothing but officers  and mr  bingley s large       fortune  the mention of which gave animation to their mother  was       worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an       ensign ,2,train
3406,after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject        mr  bennet coolly observed          from all that i can collect by your manner of talking  you must       be two of the silliest girls in the country ,2,val

3482,her       dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice            you  observed it  mr  darcy  i am sure   said miss bingley         and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see  your       sister  make such an exhibition           certainly not           to walk three miles  or four miles  or five miles  or whatever       it is  above her ankles in dirt  and alone  quite alone ,2,train
3483,what       could she mean by it ,2,train
3484,it seems to me to show an abominable sort       of conceited independence  a most country town indifference to       decorum           it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing         said bingley ,2,train
3485, i am afraid  mr  darcy   observed miss bingley  in a half       whisper   that this adventure has rather affected your admiration       of her fine eyes           not at all   he replied   they were brightened by the exercise         a short pause followed this speech  and mrs  hurst began again ,2,test
3486, i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet  she is really a       very sweet girl  and i wish with all my heart she were well       settled ,2,train
3487,but with such a father and mother  and such low       connections  i am afraid there is no chance of it           i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in       meryton           yes  and they have another  who lives somewhere near cheapside           that is capital   added her sister  and they both laughed       heartily ,2,val
3488, if they had uncles enough to fill  all  cheapside   cried       bingley   it would not make them one jot less agreeable           but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men       of any consideration in the world   replied darcy ,2,train
3489,to this speech bingley made no answer  but his sisters gave it       their hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at       the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations ,2,train
3490,with a renewal of tenderness  however  they repaired to her room       on leaving the dining parlour  and sat with her till summoned to       coffee ,2,val
3491,she was still very poorly  and elizabeth would not quit       her at all  till late in the evening  when she had the comfort of       seeing her asleep  and when it appeared to her rather right than       pleasant that she should go downstairs herself ,2,train
3492,on entering the       drawing room she found the whole party at loo  and was       immediately invited to join them  but suspecting them to be       playing high she declined it  and making her sister the excuse        said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay       below  with a book ,2,test

3494, do you prefer reading to cards   said he   that is rather       singular           miss eliza bennet   said miss bingley   despises cards ,2,test
3495,she is a       great reader  and has no pleasure in anything else           i deserve neither such praise nor such censure   cried       elizabeth   i am  not  a great reader  and i have pleasure in       many things           in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure   said       bingley   and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her       quite well          elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards a       table where a few books were lying ,2,val
3496,he immediately offered to       fetch her others  all that his library afforded ,2,train

3499,what a delightful library       you have at pemberley  mr  darcy           it ought to be good   he replied   it has been the work of many       generations           and then you have added so much to it yourself  you are always       buying books           i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days       as these           neglect ,2,train

3501,charles  when you build  your        house  i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley           i wish it may           but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that       neighbourhood  and take pemberley for a kind of model ,2,test
3502,there is       not a finer county in england than derbyshire           with all my heart  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will       sell it           i am talking of possibilities  charles           upon my word  caroline  i should think it more possible to get       pemberley by purchase than by imitation          elizabeth was so much caught by what passed  as to leave her       very little attention for her book  and soon laying it wholly       aside  she drew near the card table  and stationed herself       between mr  bingley and his eldest sister  to observe the game ,2,val

3507,her performance on the       pianoforte is exquisite           it is amazing to me   said bingley   how young ladies can have       patience to be so very accomplished as they all are           all young ladies accomplished ,2,train
3508,my dear charles  what do you       mean           yes  all of them  i think ,2,train
3509,they all paint tables  cover screens        and net purses ,2,train
3510,i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this        and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first       time  without being informed that she was very accomplished           your list of the common extent of accomplishments   said darcy         has too much truth ,2,train
3511,the word is applied to many a woman who       deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a       screen ,2,val

3513,i cannot boast of knowing more       than half a dozen  in the whole range of my acquaintance  that       are really accomplished           nor i  i am sure   said miss bingley ,2,train
3514, then   observed elizabeth   you must comprehend a great deal in       your idea of an accomplished woman           yes  i do comprehend a great deal in it           oh ,2,train
3515,certainly   cried his faithful assistant   no one can be       really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is       usually met with ,2,val
3516,a woman must have a thorough knowledge of       music  singing  drawing  dancing  and the modern languages  to       deserve the word  and besides all this  she must possess a       certain something in her air and manner of walking  the tone of       her voice  her address and expressions  or the word will be but       half deserved           all this she must possess   added darcy   and to all this she       must yet add something more substantial  in the improvement of       her mind by extensive reading           i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only  six accomplished       women ,2,train
3517,i rather wonder now at your knowing  any            are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility       of all this            i  never saw such a woman ,2,train
3518, i  never saw such capacity  and       taste  and application  and elegance  as you describe  united          mrs  hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice       of her implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew       many women who answered this description  when mr  hurst called       them to order  with bitter complaints of their inattention to       what was going forward ,2,val
3519,as all conversation was thereby at an       end  elizabeth soon afterwards left the room ,2,test
3520, eliza bennet   said miss bingley  when the door was closed       on her   is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend       themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own  and with       many men  i dare say  it succeeds ,2,train
3521,but  in my opinion  it is a       paltry device  a very mean art           undoubtedly   replied darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly       addressed   there is meanness in  all  the arts which ladies       sometimes condescend to employ for captivation ,2,train
3522,whatever bears       affinity to cunning is despicable          miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to       continue the subject ,2,train
3523,elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was       worse  and that she could not leave her ,2,train
3524,bingley urged mr  jones s       being sent for immediately  while his sisters  convinced that no       country advice could be of any service  recommended an express to       town for one of the most eminent physicians ,2,train
3525,this she would not       hear of  but she was not so unwilling to comply with their       brother s proposal  and it was settled that mr  jones should be       sent for early in the morning  if miss bennet were not decidedly       better ,2,train
3526,bingley was quite uncomfortable  his sisters declared       that they were miserable ,2,train
3527,they solaced their wretchedness        however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better       relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions       that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her       sister ,2,train
3528,chapter          elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room  and       in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable       answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr        bingley by a housemaid  and some time afterwards from the two       elegant ladies who waited on his sisters ,2,val
3529,in spite of this       amendment  however  she requested to have a note sent to       longbourn  desiring her mother to visit jane  and form her own       judgment of her situation ,2,train

3531,mrs  bennet        accompanied by her two youngest girls  reached netherfield soon       after the family breakfast ,2,train
3532,had she found jane in any apparent danger  mrs  bennet would have       been very miserable  but being satisfied on seeing her that her       illness was not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering       immediately  as her restoration to health would probably remove       her from netherfield ,2,train
3533,she would not listen  therefore  to her       daughter s proposal of being carried home  neither did the       apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think it at all       advisable ,2,val

3542, i am sure   she added   if it was not for such good friends i do       not know what would become of her  for she is very ill indeed        and suffers a vast deal  though with the greatest patience in the       world  which is always the way with her  for she has  without       exception  the sweetest temper i ever met with ,2,train

3546,you will not think of quitting it in a hurry  i       hope  though you have but a short lease           whatever i do is done in a hurry   replied he   and therefore if       i should resolve to quit netherfield  i should probably be off in       five minutes ,2,train
3547,at present  however  i consider myself as quite       fixed here           that is exactly what i should have supposed of you   said       elizabeth ,2,val

3549, oh ,2,train
3550,yes i understand you perfectly           i wish i might take this for a compliment  but to be so easily       seen through i am afraid is pitiful           that is as it happens ,2,train
3551,it does not necessarily follow that a deep  intricate       character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours           lizzy   cried her mother   remember where you are  and do not       run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home           i did not know before   continued bingley immediately   that you       were a studier of character ,2,train
3552,it must be an amusing study           yes  but intricate characters are the  most  amusing ,2,train
3553,they have       at least that advantage           the country   said darcy   can in general supply but few       subjects for such a study ,2,train
3554,in a country neighbourhood you move in       a very confined and unvarying society           but people themselves alter so much  that there is something new       to be observed in them for ever           yes  indeed   cried mrs  bennet  offended by his manner of       mentioning a country neighbourhood ,2,val
3555, i assure you there is quite       as much of  that  going on in the country as in town          everybody was surprised  and darcy  after looking at her for a       moment  turned silently away ,2,train

3559,they have       each their advantages  and i can be equally happy in either           aye that is because you have the right disposition ,2,test

3592,she longed to speak  but could think of nothing to say        and after a short silence mrs  bennet began repeating her thanks       to mr  bingley for his kindness to jane  with an apology for       troubling him also with lizzy ,2,val

3598,she had high animal spirits  and a sort of natural       self consequence  which the attentions of the officers  to whom       her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended       her  had increased into assurance ,2,train

3631,when you told mrs  bennet this morning that if       you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in       five minutes  you meant it to be a sort of panegyric  of       compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in       a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone        and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else           nay   cried bingley   this is too much  to remember at night all       the foolish things that were said in the morning ,2,test

3635,you have shown       him off now much more than he did himself           i am exceedingly gratified   said bingley   by your converting       what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my       temper ,2,train
3636,but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that       gentleman did by no means intend  for he would certainly think       the better of me  if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat       denial  and ride off as fast as i could           would mr  darcy then consider the rashness of your original       intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it           upon my word  i cannot exactly explain the matter  darcy must       speak for himself           you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call       mine  but which i have never acknowledged ,2,train
3637,allowing the case        however  to stand according to your representation  you must       remember  miss bennet  that the friend who is supposed to desire       his return to the house  and the delay of his plan  has merely       desired it  asked it without offering one argument in favour of       its propriety           to yield readily easily to the  persuasion  of a friend is no       merit with you           to yield without conviction is no compliment to the       understanding of either           you appear to me  mr  darcy  to allow nothing for the influence       of friendship and affection ,2,test

3652,she hardly knew how to suppose       that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man  and       yet that he should look at her because he disliked her  was still       more strange ,2,train

3846,may       i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse       of the moment  or are the result of previous study           they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time  and though       i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such       little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary       occasions  i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as       possible          mr  bennet s expectations were fully answered ,2,train

3859,chapter           mr  collins was not a sensible man  and the deficiency of nature       had been but little assisted by education or society  the       greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of       an illiterate and miserly father  and though he belonged to one       of the universities  he had merely kept the necessary terms        without forming at it any useful acquaintance ,2,val
3860,the subjection in       which his father had brought him up had given him originally       great humility of manner  but it was now a good deal counteracted       by the self conceit of a weak head  living in retirement  and the       consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity ,2,train
3861,a       fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh       when the living of hunsford was vacant  and the respect which he       felt for her high rank  and his veneration for her as his       patroness  mingling with a very good opinion of himself  of his       authority as a clergyman  and his right as a rector  made him       altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness  self importance       and humility ,2,train
3862,having now a good house and a very sufficient income  he intended       to marry  and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn       family he had a wife in view  as he meant to choose one of the       daughters  if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were       represented by common report ,2,train
3863,this was his plan of amends of       atonement for inheriting their father s estate  and he thought it       an excellent one  full of eligibility and suitableness  and       excessively generous and disinterested on his own part ,2,train
3864,his plan did not vary on seeing them ,2,train
3865,miss bennet s lovely face       confirmed his views  and established all his strictest notions of       what was due to seniority  and for the first evening  she  was       his settled choice ,2,train
3866,the next morning  however  made an       alteration  for in a quarter of an hour s  t te   t te  with mrs        bennet before breakfast  a conversation beginning with his       parsonage house  and leading naturally to the avowal of his       hopes  that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn        produced from her  amid very complaisant smiles and general       encouragement  a caution against the very jane he had fixed on ,2,train
3867, as to her  younger  daughters  she could not take upon her to       say she could not positively answer but she did not  know  of any       prepossession  her  eldest  daughter  she must just mention she       felt it incumbent on her to hint  was likely to be very soon       engaged          mr  collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was       soon done done while mrs  bennet was stirring the fire ,2,test
3868,elizabeth  equally next to jane in birth and beauty  succeeded       her of course ,2,test
3869,mrs  bennet treasured up the hint  and trusted that she might       soon have two daughters married  and the man whom she could not       bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces ,2,test
3870,lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten  every       sister except mary agreed to go with her  and mr  collins was to       attend them  at the request of mr  bennet  who was most anxious       to get rid of him  and have his library to himself  for thither       mr  collins had followed him after breakfast  and there he would       continue  nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the       collection  but really talking to mr  bennet  with little       cessation  of his house and garden at hunsford ,2,val
3871,such doings       discomposed mr  bennet exceedingly ,2,test
3872,in his library he had been       always sure of leisure and tranquillity  and though prepared  as       he told elizabeth  to meet with folly and conceit in every other       room of the house  he was used to be free from them there  his       civility  therefore  was most prompt in inviting mr  collins to       join his daughters in their walk  and mr  collins  being in fact       much better fitted for a walker than a reader  was extremely       pleased to close his large book  and go ,2,test
3873,in pompous nothings on his side  and civil assents on that of his       cousins  their time passed till they entered meryton ,2,train
3874,the       attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by        him  ,2,train
3875,their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in       quest of the officers  and nothing less than a very smart bonnet       indeed  or a really new muslin in a shop window  could recall       them ,2,train
3876,but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man        whom they had never seen before  of most gentlemanlike       appearance  walking with another officer on the other side of the       way ,2,val
3877,the officer was the very mr  denny concerning whose return       from london lydia came to enquire  and he bowed as they passed ,2,train
3878,all were struck with the stranger s air  all wondered who he       could be  and kitty and lydia  determined if possible to find       out  led the way across the street  under pretense of wanting       something in an opposite shop  and fortunately had just gained       the pavement when the two gentlemen  turning back  had reached       the same spot ,2,test
3879,mr  denny addressed them directly  and entreated       permission to introduce his friend  mr  wickham  who had returned       with him the day before from town  and he was happy to say had       accepted a commission in their corps ,2,train
3880,this was exactly as it       should be  for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him       completely charming ,2,test
3881,his appearance was greatly in his favour  he       had all the best part of beauty  a fine countenance  a good       figure  and very pleasing address ,2,train
3882,the introduction was followed       up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness       at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming  and the whole       party were still standing and talking together very agreeably        when the sound of horses drew their notice  and darcy and bingley       were seen riding down the street ,2,train
3883,on distinguishing the ladies of       the group  the two gentlemen came directly towards them  and       began the usual civilities ,2,train
3884,bingley was the principal spokesman        and miss bennet the principal object ,2,train
3885,he was then  he said  on       his way to longbourn on purpose to enquire after her ,2,train
3886,mr  darcy       corroborated it with a bow  and was beginning to determine not to       fix his eyes on elizabeth  when they were suddenly arrested by       the sight of the stranger  and elizabeth happening to see the       countenance of both as they looked at each other  was all       astonishment at the effect of the meeting ,2,val
3887,both changed colour        one looked white  the other red ,2,train
3888,mr  wickham  after a few       moments  touched his hat a salutation which mr  darcy just       deigned to return ,2,val
3889,what could be the meaning of it ,2,test
3890,it was       impossible to imagine  it was impossible not to long to know ,2,val
3891,in another minute  mr  bingley  but without seeming to have       noticed what passed  took leave and rode on with his friend ,2,test
3892,mr  denny and mr  wickham walked with the young ladies to the       door of mr  phillip s house  and then made their bows  in spite       of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they should come in  and       even in spite of mrs  phillips s throwing up the parlour window       and loudly seconding the invitation ,2,train
3893,mrs  phillips was always glad to see her nieces  and the two       eldest  from their recent absence  were particularly welcome  and       she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return       home  which  as their own carriage had not fetched them  she       should have known nothing about  if she had not happened to see       mr  jones s shop boy in the street  who had told her that they       were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the       miss bennets were come away  when her civility was claimed       towards mr  collins by jane s introduction of him ,2,train
3894,she received       him with her very best politeness  which he returned with as much       more  apologising for his intrusion  without any previous       acquaintance with her  which he could not help flattering       himself  however  might be justified by his relationship to the       young ladies who introduced him to her notice ,2,train
3895,mrs  phillips was       quite awed by such an excess of good breeding  but her       contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by       exclamations and enquiries about the other  of whom  however  she       could only tell her nieces what they already knew  that mr  denny       had brought him from london  and that he was to have a       lieutenant s commission in the   shire ,2,train
3896,she had been watching him       the last hour  she said  as he walked up and down the street  and       had mr  wickham appeared  kitty and lydia would certainly have       continued the occupation  but unluckily no one passed windows now       except a few of the officers  who  in comparison with the       stranger  were become  stupid  disagreeable fellows   some of       them were to dine with the phillipses the next day  and their       aunt promised to make her husband call on mr  wickham  and give       him an invitation also  if the family from longbourn would come       in the evening ,2,train
3897,this was agreed to  and mrs  phillips protested       that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery       tickets  and a little bit of hot supper afterwards ,2,test
3898,the prospect       of such delights was very cheering  and they parted in mutual       good spirits ,2,test
3899,mr  collins repeated his apologies in quitting the       room  and was assured with unwearying civility that they were       perfectly needless ,2,test
3900,as they walked home  elizabeth related to jane what she had seen       pass between the two gentlemen  but though jane would have       defended either or both  had they appeared to be in the wrong        she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister ,2,train
3901,mr  collins on his return highly gratified mrs  bennet by       admiring mrs  phillips s manners and politeness ,2,val
3902,he protested       that  except lady catherine and her daughter  he had never seen a       more elegant woman  for she had not only received him with the       utmost civility  but even pointedly included him in her       invitation for the next evening  although utterly unknown to her       before ,2,test
3903,something  he supposed  might be attributed to his       connection with them  but yet he had never met with so much       attention in the whole course of his life ,2,train
3904,chapter           as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with       their aunt  and all mr  collins s scruples of leaving mr  and       mrs  bennet for a single evening during his visit were most       steadily resisted  the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at       a suitable hour to meryton  and the girls had the pleasure of       hearing  as they entered the drawing room  that mr  wickham had       accepted their uncle s invitation  and was then in the house ,2,train
3905,when this information was given  and they had all taken their       seats  mr  collins was at leisure to look around him and admire        and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the       apartment  that he declared he might almost have supposed himself       in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings  a comparison       that did not at first convey much gratification  but when mrs        phillips understood from him what rosings was  and who was its       proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one       of lady catherine s drawing rooms  and found that the       chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds  she felt all       the force of the compliment  and would hardly have resented a       comparison with the housekeeper s room ,2,train
3906,in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her       mansion  with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble       abode  and the improvements it was receiving  he was happily       employed until the gentlemen joined them  and he found in mrs        phillips a very attentive listener  whose opinion of his       consequence increased with what she heard  and who was resolving       to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could ,2,train
3907,to       the girls  who could not listen to their cousin  and who had       nothing to do but to wish for an instrument  and examine their       own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece  the       interval of waiting appeared very long ,2,test
3908,it was over at last        however ,2,train
3909,the gentlemen did approach  and when mr  wickham walked       into the room  elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing       him before  nor thinking of him since  with the smallest degree       of unreasonable admiration ,2,val
3910,the officers of the   shire were in       general a very creditable  gentlemanlike set  and the best of       them were of the present party  but mr  wickham was as far beyond       them all in person  countenance  air  and walk  as  they  were       superior to the broad faced  stuffy uncle phillips  breathing       port wine  who followed them into the room ,2,val
3911,mr  wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female       eye was turned  and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he       finally seated himself  and the agreeable manner in which he       immediately fell into conversation  though it was only on its       being a wet night  made her feel that the commonest  dullest        most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill       of the speaker ,2,val
3912,with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr  wickham and       the officers  mr  collins seemed to sink into insignificance  to       the young ladies he certainly was nothing  but he had still at       intervals a kind listener in mrs  phillips  and was by her       watchfulness  most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin ,2,test
3913,when the card tables were placed  he had the opportunity of       obliging her in turn  by sitting down to whist ,2,train
3914, i know little of the game at present   said he   but i shall be       glad to improve myself  for in my situation in life   mrs        phillips was very glad for his compliance  but could not wait for       his reason ,2,train
3915,mr  wickham did not play at whist  and with ready delight was he       received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia ,2,train
3916,at first       there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely  for she       was a most determined talker  but being likewise extremely fond       of lottery tickets  she soon grew too much interested in the       game  too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to       have attention for anyone in particular ,2,train
3917,allowing for the common       demands of the game  mr  wickham was therefore at leisure to talk       to elizabeth  and she was very willing to hear him  though what       she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the       history of his acquaintance with mr  darcy ,2,train
3918,she dared not even       mention that gentleman ,2,train
3919,her curiosity  however  was unexpectedly       relieved ,2,train
3920,mr  wickham began the subject himself ,2,train
3921,he enquired how       far netherfield was from meryton  and  after receiving her       answer  asked in a hesitating manner how long mr  darcy had been       staying there ,2,train
3922, about a month   said elizabeth  and then  unwilling to let the       subject drop  added   he is a man of very large property in       derbyshire  i understand           yes   replied mr  wickham   his estate there is a noble one ,2,test

3924,you could not have met with a       person more capable of giving you certain information on that       head than myself  for i have been connected with his family in a       particular manner from my infancy          elizabeth could not but look surprised ,2,test
3925, you may well be surprised  miss bennet  at such an assertion        after seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our       meeting yesterday ,2,train
3926,are you much acquainted with mr  darcy           as much as i ever wish to be   cried elizabeth very warmly ,2,train
3927, i       have spent four days in the same house with him  and i think him       very disagreeable           i have no right to give  my  opinion   said wickham   as to his       being agreeable or otherwise ,2,train

3930,it is       impossible for  me  to be impartial ,2,train

3932,here you are in your       own family           upon my word  i say no more  here  than i might say in any house       in the neighbourhood  except netherfield ,2,train

3935,you will       not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone           i cannot pretend to be sorry   said wickham  after a short       interruption   that he or that any man should not be estimated       beyond their deserts  but with  him  i believe it does not often       happen ,2,train
3936,the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence  or       frightened by his high and imposing manners  and sees him only as       he chooses to be seen           i should take him  even on  my  slight acquaintance  to be an       ill tempered man   wickham only shook his head ,2,train
3937, i wonder   said he  at the next opportunity of speaking         whether he is likely to be in this country much longer           i do not at all know  but i  heard  nothing of his going away       when i was at netherfield ,2,train

3942,his father  miss bennet        the late mr  darcy  was one of the best men that ever breathed        and the truest friend i ever had  and i can never be in company       with this mr  darcy without being grieved to the soul by a       thousand tender recollections ,2,train
3943,his behaviour to myself has been       scandalous  but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and       everything  rather than his disappointing the hopes and       disgracing the memory of his father          elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase  and       listened with all her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented       further enquiry ,2,test

4085,she answered in the affirmative  and        unable to resist the temptation  added   when you met us there       the other day  we had just been forming a new acquaintance          the effect was immediate ,2,train
4086,a deeper shade of  hauteur  overspread       his features  but he said not a word  and elizabeth  though       blaming herself for her own weakness  could not go on ,2,train

4089,at that moment  sir william lucas appeared close to       them  meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the       room  but on perceiving mr  darcy  he stopped with a bow of       superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his       partner ,2,train

4096,you will not thank       me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young       lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me          the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy  but       sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him       forcibly  and his eyes were directed with a very serious       expression towards bingley and jane  who were dancing together ,2,train
4097,recovering himself  however  shortly  he turned to his partner        and said   sir william s interruption has made me forget what we       were talking of           i do not think we were speaking at all ,2,val
4098,sir william could not       have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for       themselves ,2,test

4101,no ,2,val
4102,i am sure we never read the same  or not with the       same feelings           i am sorry you think so  but if that be the case  there can at       least be no want of subject ,2,val
4103,we may compare our different       opinions           no i cannot talk of books in a ball room  my head is always full       of something else           the  present  always occupies you in such scenes does it   said       he  with a look of doubt ,2,train
4104, yes  always   she replied  without knowing what she said  for       her thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon       afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming   i remember       hearing you once say  mr  darcy  that you hardly ever forgave        that your resentment once created was unappeasable ,2,train
4105,you are very       cautious  i suppose  as to its  being created            i am   said he  with a firm voice ,2,train
4106, and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice           i hope not           it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their       opinion  to be secure of judging properly at first           may i ask to what these questions tend           merely to the illustration of  your  character   said she        endeavouring to shake off her gravity ,2,test
4107, i am trying to make it       out           and what is your success          she shook her head ,2,train
4108, i do not get on at all ,2,test
4109,i hear such       different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly           i can readily believe   answered he gravely   that reports may       vary greatly with respect to me  and i could wish  miss bennet        that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment        as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no       credit on either           but if i do not take your likeness now  i may never have another       opportunity           i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours   he coldly       replied ,2,test
4110,she said no more  and they went down the other dance and       parted in silence  and on each side dissatisfied  though not to       an equal degree  for in darcy s breast there was a tolerably       powerful feeling towards her  which soon procured her pardon  and       directed all his anger against another ,2,test
4111,they had not long separated  when miss bingley came towards her        and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her          so  miss eliza  i hear you are quite delighted with george       wickham ,2,train
4112,your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking       me a thousand questions  and i find that the young man quite       forgot to tell you  among his other communication  that he was       the son of old wickham  the late mr  darcy s steward ,2,train
4113,let me       recommend you  however  as a friend  not to give implicit       confidence to all his assertions  for as to mr  darcy s using him       ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has always       been remarkably kind to him  though george wickham has treated       mr  darcy in a most infamous manner ,2,val
4114,i do not know the       particulars  but i know very well that mr  darcy is not in the       least to blame  that he cannot bear to hear george wickham       mentioned  and that though my brother thought that he could not       well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers  he       was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the       way ,2,train
4115,his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing        indeed  and i wonder how he could presume to do it ,2,val
4116,i pity you        miss eliza  for this discovery of your favourite s guilt  but       really  considering his descent  one could not expect much       better           his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the       same   said elizabeth angrily   for i have heard you accuse him       of nothing worse than of being the son of mr  darcy s steward        and of  that   i can assure you  he informed me himself           i beg your pardon   replied miss bingley  turning away with a       sneer ,2,train
4117, excuse my interference it was kindly meant           insolent girl   said elizabeth to herself ,2,train
4118, you are much       mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as       this ,2,train
4119,i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the       malice of mr  darcy   she then sought her eldest sister  who had       undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of bingley ,2,train
4120,jane       met her with a smile of such sweet complacency  a glow of such       happy expression  as sufficiently marked how well she was       satisfied with the occurrences of the evening ,2,train
4121,elizabeth       instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for       wickham  resentment against his enemies  and everything else        gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for       happiness ,2,test
4122, i want to know   said she  with a countenance no less smiling       than her sister s   what you have learnt about mr  wickham ,2,train
4123,but       perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any       third person  in which case you may be sure of my pardon           no   replied jane   i have not forgotten him  but i have nothing       satisfactory to tell you ,2,train
4124,mr  bingley does not know the whole of       his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which       have principally offended mr  darcy  but he will vouch for the       good conduct  the probity  and honour of his friend  and is       perfectly convinced that mr  wickham has deserved much less       attention from mr  darcy than he has received  and i am sorry to       say by his account as well as his sister s  mr  wickham is by no       means a respectable young man ,2,val
4125,i am afraid he has been very       imprudent  and has deserved to lose mr  darcy s regard           mr ,2,val
4126,bingley does not know mr  wickham himself           no  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton           this account then is what he has received from mr  darcy ,2,test
4127,i am       satisfied ,2,train
4128,but what does he say of the living           he does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has       heard them from mr  darcy more than once  but he believes that it       was left to him  conditionally  only           i have not a doubt of mr  bingley s sincerity   said elizabeth       warmly   but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances       only ,2,train
4129,mr  bingley s defense of his friend was a very able one  i       dare say  but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the       story  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself  i shall       venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before          she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each        and on which there could be no difference of sentiment ,2,train
4130,elizabeth       listened with delight to the happy  though modest hopes which       jane entertained of mr  bingley s regard  and said all in her       power to heighten her confidence in it ,2,test
4131,on their being joined by       mr  bingley himself  elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas  to whose       enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had       scarcely replied  before mr  collins came up to them  and told       her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as       to make a most important discovery ,2,train
4132, i have found out   said he   by a singular accident  that there       is now in the room a near relation of my patroness ,2,train

4134,how wonderfully these       sort of things occur ,2,train

4137,my total ignorance of the       connection must plead my apology           you are not going to introduce yourself to mr  darcy           indeed i am ,2,train
4138,i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it       earlier ,2,train
4139,i believe him to be lady catherine s  nephew  ,2,train
4140,it will       be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well       yesterday se nnight          elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring       him that mr  darcy would consider his addressing him without       introduction as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment       to his aunt  that it was not in the least necessary there should       be any notice on either side  and that if it were  it must belong       to mr  darcy  the superior in consequence  to begin the       acquaintance ,2,train
4141,mr  collins listened to her with the determined air       of following his own inclination  and  when she ceased speaking        replied thus          my dear miss elizabeth  i have the highest opinion in the world       in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of       your understanding  but permit me to say  that there must be a       wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst       the laity  and those which regulate the clergy  for  give me       leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in       point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided       that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time       maintained ,2,train
4142,you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of       my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to perform what i       look on as a point of duty ,2,test
4143,pardon me for neglecting to profit by       your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant       guide  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted       by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a       young lady like yourself   and with a low bow he left her to       attack mr  darcy  whose reception of his advances she eagerly       watched  and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very       evident ,2,train
4144,her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and       though she could not hear a word of it  she felt as if hearing it       all  and saw in the motion of his lips the words  apology          hunsford   and  lady catherine de bourgh   it vexed her to see       him expose himself to such a man ,2,val
4145,mr  darcy was eyeing him with       unrestrained wonder  and when at last mr  collins allowed him       time to speak  replied with an air of distant civility ,2,train
4146,mr        collins  however  was not discouraged from speaking again  and       mr  darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length       of his second speech  and at the end of it he only made him a       slight bow  and moved another way ,2,train
4147,mr  collins then returned to       elizabeth ,2,test
4148, i have no reason  i assure you   said he   to be dissatisfied       with my reception ,2,train
4149,mr  darcy seemed much pleased with the       attention ,2,val
4150,he answered me with the utmost civility  and even paid       me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady       catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a       favour unworthily ,2,test
4151,it was really a very handsome thought ,2,train
4152,upon       the whole  i am much pleased with him          as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she       turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr        bingley  and the train of agreeable reflections which her       observations gave birth to  made her perhaps almost as happy as       jane ,2,train
4153,she saw her in idea settled in that very house  in all the       felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow  and she       felt capable  under such circumstances  of endeavouring even to       like bingley s two sisters ,2,train
4154,her mother s thoughts she plainly saw       were bent the same way  and she determined not to venture near       her  lest she might hear too much ,2,train
4155,when they sat down to supper        therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which       placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to       find that her mother was talking to that one person  lady lucas        freely  openly  and of nothing else but her expectation that jane       would soon be married to mr  bingley ,2,train
4156,it was an animating       subject  and mrs  bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while       enumerating the advantages of the match ,2,train
4157,his being such a       charming young man  and so rich  and living but three miles from       them  were the first points of self gratulation  and then it was       such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane        and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as       she could do ,2,test
4158,it was  moreover  such a promising thing for her       younger daughters  as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them       in the way of other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at       her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to       the care of their sister  that she might not be obliged to go       into company more than she liked ,2,train
4159,it was necessary to make this       circumstance a matter of pleasure  because on such occasions it       is the etiquette  but no one was less likely than mrs  bennet to       find comfort in staying home at any period of her life ,2,train
4160,she       concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be       equally fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing       there was no chance of it ,2,train
4161,in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her       mother s words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a       less audible whisper  for  to her inexpressible vexation  she       could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr  darcy        who sat opposite to them ,2,train

4168,elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation ,2,train
4169,she       could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr  darcy  though       every glance convinced her of what she dreaded  for though he was       not always looking at her mother  she was convinced that his       attention was invariably fixed by her ,2,test
4170,the expression of his face       changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and       steady gravity ,2,train
4171,at length  however  mrs  bennet had no more to say  and lady       lucas  who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights       which she saw no likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts       of cold ham and chicken ,2,train
4172,elizabeth now began to revive ,2,train
4173,but not       long was the interval of tranquillity  for  when supper was over        singing was talked of  and she had the mortification of seeing       mary  after very little entreaty  preparing to oblige the       company ,2,train
4174,by many significant looks and silent entreaties  did she       endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance  but in vain        mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of exhibiting       was delightful to her  and she began her song ,2,train
4175,elizabeth s eyes       were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched       her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which       was very ill rewarded at their close  for mary  on receiving        amongst the thanks of the table  the hint of a hope that she       might be prevailed on to favour them again  after the pause of       half a minute began another ,2,train

4182,you have delighted us long       enough ,2,test
4183,let the other young ladies have time to exhibit          mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted        and elizabeth  sorry for her  and sorry for her father s speech        was afraid her anxiety had done no good ,2,val

4185, if i   said mr  collins   were so fortunate as to be able to       sing  i should have great pleasure  i am sure  in obliging the       company with an air  for i consider music as a very innocent       diversion  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a       clergyman ,2,test

4187,the rector of a       parish has much to do ,2,train

4191,i cannot acquit him of that duty        nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of       testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the       family   and with a bow to mr  darcy  he concluded his speech        which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room ,2,test
4192,many stared many smiled  but no one looked more amused than mr        bennet himself  while his wife seriously commended mr  collins       for having spoken so sensibly  and observed in a half whisper to       lady lucas  that he was a remarkably clever  good kind of young       man ,2,train
4193,to elizabeth it appeared that  had her family made an agreement       to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it       would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more       spirit or finer success  and happy did she think it for bingley       and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his       notice  and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much       distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed ,2,train
4194,that his       two sisters and mr  darcy  however  should have such an       opportunity of ridiculing her relations  was bad enough  and she       could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman        or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable ,2,train
4195,the rest of the evening brought her little amusement ,2,train
4196,she was       teased by mr  collins  who continued most perseveringly by her       side  and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him       again  put it out of her power to dance with others ,2,train
4197,in vain did       she entreat him to stand up with somebody else  and offer to       introduce him to any young lady in the room ,2,val
4198,he assured her  that       as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it  that his chief       object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and       that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her       the whole evening ,2,test
4199,there was no arguing upon such a project ,2,test

4240,thus much for my general       intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my       views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own       neighbourhood  where i can assure you there are many amiable       young women ,2,train
4241,but the fact is  that being  as i am  to inherit       this estate after the death of your honoured father  who        however  may live many years longer   i could not satisfy myself       without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters  that       the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the       melancholy event takes place which  however  as i have already       said  may not be for several years ,2,train

4263,my situation in life  my connections with the family       of de bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are circumstances       highly in my favour  and you should take it into further       consideration  that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is       by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be       made you ,2,test

4277,if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit        perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me        because if liable to such defects of temper  she could not       contribute much to my felicity           sir  you quite misunderstand me   said mrs  bennet  alarmed ,2,train

4331,perhaps       not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had       my fair cousin honoured me with her hand  for i have often       observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the       blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our       estimation ,2,test

4337,as for the gentleman himself   his        feelings were chiefly expressed  not by embarrassment or       dejection  or by trying to avoid her  but by stiffness of manner       and resentful silence ,2,train
4338,he scarcely ever spoke to her  and the       assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself       were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas  whose       civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all        and especially to her friend ,2,test

4347,his accompanying them was a double       advantage  she felt all the compliment it offered to herself  and       it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her       father and mother ,2,train
4348,soon after their return  a letter was delivered to miss bennet        it came from netherfield ,2,train
4349,the envelope contained a sheet of       elegant  little  hot pressed paper  well covered with a lady s       fair  flowing hand  and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance       change as she read it  and saw her dwelling intently on some       particular passages ,2,train
4350,jane recollected herself soon  and putting       the letter away  tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the       general conversation  but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the       subject which drew off her attention even from wickham  and no       sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from       jane invited her to follow her up stairs ,2,train

4354,the next was in these words         i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in       hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend  but we       will hope  at some future period  to enjoy many returns of that       delightful intercourse we have known  and in the meanwhile may       lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most       unreserved correspondence ,2,val
4355,i depend on you for that   to these       highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the       insensibility of distrust  and though the suddenness of their       removal surprised her  she saw nothing in it really to lament  it       was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would       prevent mr  bingley s being there  and as to the loss of their       society  she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it  in       the enjoyment of his ,2,train

4383,could she have seen half as       much love in mr  darcy for herself  she would have ordered her       wedding clothes ,2,train
4384,but the case is this  we are not rich enough or       grand enough for them  and she is the more anxious to get miss       darcy for her brother  from the notion that when there has been        one  intermarriage  she may have less trouble in achieving a       second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and i dare       say it would succeed  if miss de bourgh were out of the way ,2,train
4385,but        my dearest jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because miss       bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy  he is       in the smallest degree less sensible of  your  merit than when he       took leave of you on tuesday  or that it will be in her power to       persuade him that  instead of being in love with you  he is very       much in love with her friend           if we thought alike of miss bingley   replied jane   your       representation of all this might make me quite easy ,2,val

4391, you must know       that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their       disapprobation  i could not hesitate           i did not think you would  and that being the case  i cannot       consider your situation with much compassion           but if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be       required ,2,train
4392,a thousand things may arise in six months          the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the       utmost contempt ,2,val
4393,it appeared to her merely the suggestion of       caroline s interested wishes  and she could not for a moment       suppose that those wishes  however openly or artfully spoken        could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone ,2,train
4394,she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she       felt on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its       happy effect ,2,val
4395,jane s temper was not desponding  and she was       gradually led to hope  though the diffidence of affection       sometimes overcame the hope  that bingley would return to       netherfield and answer every wish of her heart ,2,train
4396,they agreed that mrs  bennet should only hear of the departure of       the family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s       conduct  but even this partial communication gave her a great       deal of concern  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that       the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting       so intimate together ,2,train
4397,after lamenting it  however  at some       length  she had the consolation that mr  bingley would be soon       down again and soon dining at longbourn  and the conclusion of       all was the comfortable declaration  that though he had been       invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two       full courses ,2,train
4398,chapter           the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again       during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen       to mr  collins ,2,test

4400, it keeps him in good humour   said she   and i am more obliged       to you than i can express   charlotte assured her friend of her       satisfaction in being useful  and that it amply repaid her for       the little sacrifice of her time ,2,test
4401,this was very amiable  but       charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any       conception of  its object was nothing else than to secure her       from any return of mr  collins s addresses  by engaging them       towards herself ,2,test
4402,such was miss lucas s scheme  and appearances       were so favourable  that when they parted at night  she would       have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave       hertfordshire so very soon ,2,train
4403,but here she did injustice to the       fire and independence of his character  for it led him to escape       out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness        and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet ,2,train
4404,he was       anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins  from a conviction       that if they saw him depart  they could not fail to conjecture       his design  and he was not willing to have the attempt known till       its success might be known likewise  for though feeling almost       secure  and with reason  for charlotte had been tolerably       encouraging  he was comparatively diffident since the adventure       of wednesday ,2,val
4405,his reception  however  was of the most flattering       kind ,2,train
4406,miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked       towards the house  and instantly set out to meet him accidentally       in the lane ,2,train

4408,in as short a time as mr  collins s long speeches would allow        everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both        and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name       the day that was to make him the happiest of men  and though such       a solicitation must be waived for the present  the lady felt no       inclination to trifle with his happiness ,2,train
4409,the stupidity with       which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any       charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance  and miss       lucas  who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested       desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that establishment       were gained ,2,train
4410,sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their       consent  and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity ,2,val

4412,lady lucas       began directly to calculate  with more interest than the matter       had ever excited before  how many years longer mr  bennet was       likely to live  and sir william gave it as his decided opinion        that whenever mr  collins should be in possession of the       longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and       his wife should make their appearance at st  james s ,2,train

4414,the       younger girls formed hopes of  coming out  a year or two sooner       than they might otherwise have done  and the boys were relieved       from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid ,2,train

4420,without thinking highly either of men or matrimony        marriage had always been her object  it was the only provision       for well educated young women of small fortune  and however       uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest       preservative from want ,2,train
4421,this preservative she had now obtained        and at the age of twenty seven  without having ever been       handsome  she felt all the good luck of it ,2,val
4422,the least agreeable       circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to       elizabeth bennet  whose friendship she valued beyond that of any       other person ,2,val

4424,she resolved to give her       the information herself  and therefore charged mr  collins  when       he returned to longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had       passed before any of the family ,2,val
4425,a promise of secrecy was of       course very dutifully given  but it could not be kept without       difficulty  for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst       forth in such very direct questions on his return as required       some ingenuity to evade  and he was at the same time exercising       great self denial  for he was longing to publish his prosperous       love ,2,train
4426,as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any       of the family  the ceremony of leave taking was performed when       the ladies moved for the night  and mrs  bennet  with great       politeness and cordiality  said how happy they should be to see       him at longbourn again  whenever his engagements might allow him       to visit them ,2,train

4428,you had better neglect your relations than run the       risk of offending your patroness           my dear sir   replied mr  collins   i am particularly obliged to       you for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not       taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence           you cannot be too much upon your guard ,2,train
4429,risk anything rather       than her displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by       your coming to us again  which i should think exceedingly       probable  stay quietly at home  and be satisfied that  we  shall       take no offence           believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such       affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily       receive from me a letter of thanks for this  and for every other       mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire ,2,val
4430,as for my       fair cousins  though my absence may not be long enough to render       it necessary  i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health       and happiness  not excepting my cousin elizabeth          with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them       equally surprised that he meditated a quick return ,2,train

4432,she rated his abilities much higher       than any of the others  there was a solidity in his reflections       which often struck her  and though by no means so clever as       herself  she thought that if encouraged to read and improve       himself by such an example as hers  he might become a very       agreeable companion ,2,val

4434,miss lucas called soon after breakfast        and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of       the day before ,2,train
4435,the possibility of mr  collins s fancying himself in love with       her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or       two  but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far       from possibility as she could encourage him herself  and her       astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first       the bounds of decorum  and she could not help crying out          engaged to mr  collins ,2,test
4436,my dear charlotte impossible          the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling       her story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so       direct a reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected        she soon regained her composure  and calmly replied          why should you be surprised  my dear eliza ,2,test
4437,do you think it       incredible that mr  collins should be able to procure any woman s       good opinion  because he was not so happy as to succeed with       you          but elizabeth had now recollected herself  and making a strong       effort for it  was able to assure with tolerable firmness that       the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her        and that she wished her all imaginable happiness ,2,train
4438, i see what you are feeling   replied charlotte ,2,test
4439, you must be       surprised  very much surprised so lately as mr  collins was       wishing to marry you ,2,test

4443,charlotte did not       stay much longer  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what       she had heard ,2,train
4444,it was a long time before she became at all       reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match ,2,train
4445,the strangeness       of mr  collins s making two offers of marriage within three days       was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted ,2,train
4446,she had       always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly       like her own  but she had not supposed it to be possible that        when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better       feeling to worldly advantage ,2,train
4447,charlotte the wife of mr  collins       was a most humiliating picture ,2,test
4448,and to the pang of a friend       disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem  was added the       distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to       be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen ,2,train
4449,chapter           elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on       what she had heard  and doubting whether she was authorised to       mention it  when sir william lucas himself appeared  sent by his       daughter  to announce her engagement to the family ,2,train
4450,with many       compliments to them  and much self gratulation on the prospect of       a connection between the houses  he unfolded the matter to an       audience not merely wondering  but incredulous  for mrs  bennet        with more perseverance than politeness  protested he must be       entirely mistaken  and lydia  always unguarded and often uncivil        boisterously exclaimed          good lord ,2,train
4451,sir william  how can you tell such a story ,2,val
4452,do not       you know that mr  collins wants to marry lizzy          nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne       without anger such treatment  but sir william s good breeding       carried him through it all  and though he begged leave to be       positive as to the truth of his information  he listened to all       their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy ,2,train
4453,elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so       unpleasant a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his       account  by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte       herself  and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her       mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to       sir william  in which she was readily joined by jane  and by       making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be       expected from the match  the excellent character of mr  collins        and the convenient distance of hunsford from london ,2,train
4454,mrs  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal       while sir william remained  but no sooner had he left them than       her feelings found a rapid vent ,2,train
4455,in the first place  she       persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter  secondly  she       was very sure that mr  collins had been taken in  thirdly  she       trusted that they would never be happy together  and fourthly        that the match might be broken off ,2,train
4456,two inferences  however  were       plainly deduced from the whole  one  that elizabeth was the real       cause of the mischief  and the other that she herself had been       barbarously misused by them all  and on these two points she       principally dwelt during the rest of the day ,2,val
4457,nothing could       console and nothing could appease her ,2,train
4458,nor did that day wear out       her resentment ,2,test
4459,a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth       without scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak       to sir william or lady lucas without being rude  and many months       were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter ,2,train
4460,mr  bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion        and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most       agreeable sort  for it gratified him  he said  to discover that       charlotte lucas  whom he had been used to think tolerably       sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and more foolish than his       daughter ,2,val
4461,jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she       said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for       their happiness  nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it       as improbable ,2,train
4462,kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas        for mr  collins was only a clergyman  and it affected them in no       other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton ,2,train
4463,lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to       retort on mrs  bennet the comfort of having a daughter well       married  and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to       say how happy she was  though mrs  bennet s sour looks and       ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness       away ,2,val
4464,between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept       them mutually silent on the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded       that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again ,2,test
4465,her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard       to her sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her       opinion could never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew       daily more anxious  as bingley had now been gone a week and       nothing more was heard of his return ,2,train
4466,jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter  and was       counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again ,2,val
4467,the promised letter of thanks from mr  collins arrived on       tuesday  addressed to their father  and written with all the       solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth s abode in the family       might have prompted ,2,train
4468,after discharging his conscience on that       head  he proceeded to inform them  with many rapturous       expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection of       their amiable neighbour  miss lucas  and then explained that it       was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been       so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at       longbourn  whither he hoped to be able to return on monday       fortnight  for lady catherine  he added  so heartily approved his       marriage  that she wished it to take place as soon as possible        which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his       amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the       happiest of men ,2,test
4469,mr  collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of       pleasure to mrs  bennet ,2,train
4470,on the contrary  she was as much       disposed to complain of it as her husband ,2,train
4471,it was very strange       that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  it       was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome ,2,val
4472,she hated       having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent        and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable ,2,val
4473,such were       the gentle murmurs of mrs  bennet  and they gave way only to the       greater distress of mr  bingley s continued absence ,2,train
4474,neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject ,2,val
4475,day       after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him       than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming       no more to netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly       incensed mrs  bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as       a most scandalous falsehood ,2,train
4476,even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but       that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away ,2,test
4477,unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s       happiness  and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover  she       could not prevent its frequently occurring ,2,train
4478,the united efforts of       his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend        assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of       london might be too much  she feared  for the strength of his       attachment ,2,val
4479,as for jane   her  anxiety under this suspense was  of course        more painful than elizabeth s  but whatever she felt she was       desirous of concealing  and between herself and elizabeth        therefore  the subject was never alluded to ,2,train
4480,but as no such       delicacy restrained her mother  an hour seldom passed in which       she did not talk of bingley  express her impatience for his       arrival  or even require jane to confess that if he did not come       back she would think herself very ill used ,2,test

4482,mr  collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight  but his       reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been       on his first introduction ,2,train
4483,he was too happy  however  to need       much attention  and luckily for the others  the business of       love making relieved them from a great deal of his company ,2,test

4485,mrs  bennet was really in a most pitiable state ,2,train

4508,had his own happiness        however  been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to       sport with it in whatever manner he thought best  but her       sister s was involved in it  as she thought he must be sensible       himself ,2,test

4624,change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief       from home may be as useful as anything          elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal  and felt       persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence ,2,test

4627,my dear aunt  how could you think       of it ,2,test
4628,mr  darcy may perhaps have  heard  of such a place as       gracechurch street  but he would hardly think a month s ablution       enough to cleanse him from its impurities  were he once to enter       it  and depend upon it  mr  bingley never stirs without him           so much the better ,2,train

4632,it was possible  and sometimes       she thought it probable  that his affection might be reanimated        and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the       more natural influence of jane s attractions ,2,train
4633,miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure  and the       bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time  than       as she hoped by caroline s not living in the same house with her       brother  she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without       any danger of seeing him ,2,train

4637,without supposing       them  from what she saw  to be very seriously in love  their       preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little       uneasy  and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject       before she left hertfordshire  and represent to her the       imprudence of encouraging such an attachment ,2,train

4667,at least  you should not  remind  your mother of       inviting him           as i did the other day   said elizabeth with a conscious smile         very true  it will be wise in me to refrain from  that  ,2,test

4704,but        my dear sister  though the event has proved you right  do not       think me obstinate if i still assert that  considering what her       behaviour was  my confidence was as natural as your suspicion ,2,train

4708,i pity  though i cannot help blaming her ,2,train
4709,she was very       wrong in singling me out as she did  i can safely say that every       advance to intimacy began on her side ,2,train
4710,but i pity her  because       she must feel that she has been acting wrong  and because i am       very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it ,2,train
4711,i need       not explain myself farther  and though  we  know this anxiety to       be quite needless  yet if she feels it  it will easily account       for her behaviour to me  and so deservedly dear as he is to his       sister  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural       and amiable ,2,train

4714,i cannot understand it ,2,train
4715,if i were       not afraid of judging harshly  i should be almost tempted to say       that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this ,2,train

4726,mrs  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise       concerning that gentleman  and required information  and       elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to       her aunt than to herself ,2,train

4730,the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most       remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering       himself agreeable  but elizabeth  less clear sighted perhaps in       this case than in charlotte s  did not quarrel with him for his       wish of independence ,2,train
4731,nothing  on the contrary  could be more       natural  and while able to suppose that it cost him a few       struggles to relinquish her  she was ready to allow it a wise and       desirable measure for both  and could very sincerely wish him       happy ,2,train
4732,all this was acknowledged to mrs  gardiner  and after relating       the circumstances  she thus went on   i am now convinced  my dear       aunt  that i have never been much in love  for had i really       experienced that pure and elevating passion  i should at present       detest his very name  and wish him all manner of evil ,2,train

4742,absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte       again  and weakened her disgust of mr  collins ,2,train
4743,there was novelty       in the scheme  and as  with such a mother and such       uncompanionable sisters  home could not be faultless  a little       change was not unwelcome for its own sake ,2,val

4799,mrs  collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure  and       elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found       herself so affectionately received ,2,train
4800,she saw instantly that her       cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage  his formal       civility was just what it had been  and he detained her some       minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all       her family ,2,train

4803,but though everything seemed neat and       comfortable  she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of       repentance  and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she       could have so cheerful an air with such a companion ,2,train

4805,once or twice she could discern a       faint blush  but in general charlotte wisely did not hear ,2,train

4807,to work in this garden was one of his most       respectable pleasures  and elizabeth admired the command of       countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of       the exercise  and owned she encouraged it as much as possible ,2,train
4808,here  leading the way through every walk and cross walk  and       scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked       for  every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left       beauty entirely behind ,2,train
4809,he could number the fields in every       direction  and could tell how many trees there were in the most       distant clump ,2,train
4810,but of all the views which his garden  or which       the country or kingdom could boast  none were to be compared with       the prospect of rosings  afforded by an opening in the trees that       bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house ,2,train
4811,it was       a handsome modern building  well situated on rising ground ,2,train
4812,from his garden  mr  collins would have led them round his two       meadows  but the ladies  not having shoes to encounter the       remains of a white frost  turned back  and while sir william       accompanied him  charlotte took her sister and friend over the       house  extremely well pleased  probably  to have the opportunity       of showing it without her husband s help ,2,val
4813,it was rather small        but well built and convenient  and everything was fitted up and       arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave       charlotte all the credit ,2,train
4814,when mr  collins could be forgotten        there was really an air of great comfort throughout  and by       charlotte s evident enjoyment of it  elizabeth supposed he must       be often forgotten ,2,val

4823,she is the sort       of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference          the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news        and telling again what had already been written  and when it       closed  elizabeth  in the solitude of her chamber  had to       meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment  to understand       her address in guiding  and composure in bearing with  her       husband  and to acknowledge that it was all done very well ,2,train
4824,she       had also to anticipate how her visit would pass  the quiet tenor       of their usual employments  the vexatious interruptions of mr        collins  and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings ,2,train
4825,a       lively imagination soon settled it all ,2,train
4826,about the middle of the next day  as she was in her room getting       ready for a walk  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole       house in confusion  and  after listening a moment  she heard       somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry  and calling loudly       after her ,2,test
4827,she opened the door and met maria in the landing       place  who  breathless with agitation  cried out          oh  my dear eliza ,2,test

4841,yes  she will do for him very well ,2,val
4842,she will make him a very proper wife          mr  collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in       conversation with the ladies  and sir william  to elizabeth s       high diversion  was stationed in the doorway  in earnest       contemplation of the greatness before him  and constantly bowing       whenever miss de bourgh looked that way ,2,val
4843,at length there was nothing more to be said  the ladies drove on        and the others returned into the house ,2,train

4845,chapter           mr  collins s triumph  in consequence of this invitation  was       complete ,2,train
4846,the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness       to his wondering visitors  and of letting them see her civility       towards himself and his wife  was exactly what he had wished for        and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon  was       such an instance of lady catherine s condescension  as he knew       not how to admire enough ,2,test
4847, i confess   said he   that i should not have been at all       surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and       spend the evening at rosings ,2,train

4850,who could have imagined       that we should receive an invitation to dine there  an       invitation  moreover  including the whole party  so immediately       after your arrival           i am the less surprised at what has happened   replied sir       william   from that knowledge of what the manners of the great       really are  which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire ,2,train
4851,about the court  such instances of elegant breeding are not       uncommon          scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but       their visit to rosings ,2,train
4852,mr  collins was carefully instructing       them in what they were to expect  that the sight of such rooms        so many servants  and so splendid a dinner  might not wholly       overpower them ,2,test
4853,when the ladies were separating for the toilette  he said to       elizabeth          do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel ,2,val
4854,lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us       which becomes herself and her daughter ,2,test

4857,she likes to have the       distinction of rank preserved          while they were dressing  he came two or three times to their       different doors  to recommend their being quick  as lady       catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner ,2,train
4858,such formidable accounts of her ladyship  and her manner of       living  quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to       company  and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings       with as much apprehension as her father had done to his       presentation at st  james s ,2,train
4859,as the weather was fine  they had a pleasant walk of about half a       mile across the park ,2,train
4860,every park has its beauty and its       prospects  and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with  though she       could not be in such raptures as mr  collins expected the scene       to inspire  and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of       the windows in front of the house  and his relation of what the       glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh ,2,train
4861,when they ascended the steps to the hall  maria s alarm was every       moment increasing  and even sir william did not look perfectly       calm ,2,train
4862,elizabeth s courage did not fail her ,2,train
4863,she had heard nothing       of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary       talents or miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money       or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation ,2,val
4864,from the entrance hall  of which mr  collins pointed out  with a       rapturous air  the fine proportion and the finished ornaments        they followed the servants through an ante chamber  to the room       where lady catherine  her daughter  and mrs  jenkinson were       sitting ,2,train
4865,her ladyship  with great condescension  arose to receive       them  and as mrs  collins had settled it with her husband that       the office of introduction should be hers  it was performed in a       proper manner  without any of those apologies and thanks which he       would have thought necessary ,2,train
4866,in spite of having been at st  james s  sir william was so       completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him  that he had but       just courage enough to make a very low bow  and take his seat       without saying a word  and his daughter  frightened almost out of       her senses  sat on the edge of her chair  not knowing which way       to look ,2,train
4867,elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene  and       could observe the three ladies before her composedly ,2,train
4868,lady       catherine was a tall  large woman  with strongly marked features        which might once have been handsome ,2,train
4869,her air was not       conciliating  nor was her manner of receiving them such as to       make her visitors forget their inferior rank ,2,train
4870,she was not       rendered formidable by silence  but whatever she said was spoken       in so authoritative a tone  as marked her self importance  and       brought mr  wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind  and from the       observation of the day altogether  she believed lady catherine to       be exactly what he represented ,2,test
4871,when  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and       deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr  darcy  she       turned her eyes on the daughter  she could almost have joined in       maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small ,2,train
4872,there was       neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies ,2,test
4873,miss       de bourgh was pale and sickly  her features  though not plain        were insignificant  and she spoke very little  except in a low       voice  to mrs  jenkinson  in whose appearance there was nothing       remarkable  and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she       said  and placing a screen in the proper direction before her       eyes ,2,train
4874,after sitting a few minutes  they were all sent to one of the       windows to admire the view  mr  collins attending them to point       out its beauties  and lady catherine kindly informing them that       it was much better worth looking at in the summer ,2,test
4875,the dinner was exceedingly handsome  and there were all the       servants and all the articles of plate which mr  collins had       promised  and  as he had likewise foretold  he took his seat at       the bottom of the table  by her ladyship s desire  and looked as       if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater ,2,train
4876,he carved        and ate  and praised with delighted alacrity  and every dish was       commended  first by him and then by sir william  who was now       enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said  in a       manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear ,2,train
4877,but       lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration        and gave most gracious smiles  especially when any dish on the       table proved a novelty to them ,2,train
4878,the party did not supply much       conversation ,2,train
4879,elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an       opening  but she was seated between charlotte and miss de       bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady       catherine  and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time ,2,test
4880,mrs  jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss       de bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing       she was indisposed ,2,train
4881,maria thought speaking out of the question        and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire ,2,train
4882,when the ladies returned to the drawing room  there was little to       be done but to hear lady catherine talk  which she did without       any intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on       every subject in so decisive a manner  as proved that she was not       used to have her judgement controverted ,2,test
4883,she enquired into       charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely  gave her a       great deal of advice as to the management of them all  told her       how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as       hers  and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her       poultry ,2,test
4884,elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great       lady s attention  which could furnish her with an occasion of       dictating to others ,2,train
4885,in the intervals of her discourse with mrs        collins  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and       elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she       knew the least  and who she observed to mrs  collins was a very       genteel  pretty kind of girl ,2,train
4886,she asked her  at different times        how many sisters she had  whether they were older or younger than       herself  whether any of them were likely to be married  whether       they were handsome  where they had been educated  what carriage       her father kept  and what had been her mother s maiden name ,2,train
4887,elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered       them very composedly ,2,train
4888,lady catherine then observed          your father s estate is entailed on mr  collins  i think ,2,train

4938,from       these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the       coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr  collins s       side and as many bows on sir william s they departed ,2,val
4939,as soon as       they had driven from the door  elizabeth was called on by her       cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings        which  for charlotte s sake  she made more favourable than it       really was ,2,train
4940,but her commendation  though costing her some       trouble  could by no means satisfy mr  collins  and he was very       soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands ,2,train
4941,chapter           sir william stayed only a week at hunsford  but his visit was       long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most       comfortably settled  and of her possessing such a husband and       such a neighbour as were not often met with ,2,val
4942,while sir william       was with them  mr  collins devoted his morning to driving him out       in his gig  and showing him the country  but when he went away        the whole family returned to their usual employments  and       elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her       cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between       breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the       garden or in reading and writing  and looking out of the window       in his own book room  which fronted the road ,2,test
4943,the room in which       the ladies sat was backwards ,2,train
4944,elizabeth had at first rather       wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for       common use  it was a better sized room  and had a more pleasant       aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason       for what she did  for mr  collins would undoubtedly have been       much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally       lively  and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement ,2,train
4945,from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane        and were indebted to mr  collins for the knowledge of what       carriages went along  and how often especially miss de bourgh       drove by in her phaeton  which he never failed coming to inform       them of  though it happened almost every day ,2,train
4946,she not       unfrequently stopped at the parsonage  and had a few minutes        conversation with charlotte  but was scarcely ever prevailed upon       to get out ,2,train
4947,very few days passed in which mr  collins did not walk to       rosings  and not many in which his wife did not think it       necessary to go likewise  and till elizabeth recollected that       there might be other family livings to be disposed of  she could       not understand the sacrifice of so many hours ,2,train
4948,now and then they       were honoured with a call from her ladyship  and nothing escaped       her observation that was passing in the room during these visits ,2,val
4949,she examined into their employments  looked at their work  and       advised them to do it differently  found fault with the       arrangement of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in       negligence  and if she accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it       only for the sake of finding out that mrs  collins s joints of       meat were too large for her family ,2,train
4950,elizabeth soon perceived  that though this great lady was not in       the commission of the peace of the county  she was a most active       magistrate in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were       carried to her by mr  collins  and whenever any of the cottagers       were disposed to be quarrelsome  discontented  or too poor  she       sallied forth into the village to settle their differences        silence their complaints  and scold them into harmony and plenty ,2,train
4951,the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a       week  and  allowing for the loss of sir william  and there being       only one card table in the evening  every such entertainment was       the counterpart of the first ,2,train
4952,their other engagements were few        as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond       mr  collins s reach ,2,train
4953,this  however  was no evil to elizabeth  and       upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough  there were       half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte  and the       weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great       enjoyment out of doors ,2,val
4954,her favourite walk  and where she       frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine        was along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where       there was a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but       herself  and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s       curiosity ,2,train
4955,in this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed       away ,2,test
4956,easter was approaching  and the week preceding it was to       bring an addition to the family at rosings  which in so small a       circle must be important ,2,train
4957,elizabeth had heard soon after her       arrival that mr  darcy was expected there in the course of a few       weeks  and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom       she did not prefer  his coming would furnish one comparatively       new to look at in their rosings parties  and she might be amused       in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were  by his       behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently destined by       lady catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest       satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration        and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been       frequently seen by miss lucas and herself ,2,train
4958,his arrival was soon known at the parsonage  for mr  collins was       walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into       hunsford lane  in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and       after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park        hurried home with the great intelligence ,2,train
4959,on the following       morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects ,2,test
4960,there were       two nephews of lady catherine to require them  for mr  darcy had       brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam  the younger son of his       uncle lord     and  to the great surprise of all the party  when       mr  collins returned  the gentlemen accompanied him ,2,test

4966,colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the       readiness and ease of a well bred man  and talked very       pleasantly  but his cousin  after having addressed a slight       observation on the house and garden to mrs  collins  sat for some       time without speaking to anybody ,2,train
4967,at length  however  his       civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the       health of her family ,2,val

4969,have you       never happened to see her there          she was perfectly sensible that he never had  but she wished to       see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed       between the bingleys and jane  and she thought he looked a little       confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to       meet miss bennet ,2,train
4970,the subject was pursued no farther  and the       gentlemen soon afterwards went away ,2,train
4971,chapter           colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the       parsonage  and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably       to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings ,2,train
4972,it was some       days  however  before they received any invitation thither for       while there were visitors in the house  they could not be       necessary  and it was not till easter day  almost a week after       the gentlemen s arrival  that they were honoured by such an       attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to       come there in the evening ,2,train

4976,her ladyship       received them civilly  but it was plain that their company was by       no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else  and she       was  in fact  almost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them        especially to darcy  much more than to any other person in the       room ,2,train
4977,colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  anything was       a welcome relief to him at rosings  and mrs  collins s pretty       friend had moreover caught his fancy very much ,2,train
4978,he now seated       himself by her  and talked so agreeably of kent and       hertfordshire  of travelling and staying at home  of new books       and music  that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained       in that room before  and they conversed with so much spirit and       flow  as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself  as well       as of mr  darcy ,2,train
4979, his  eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned       towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship        after a while  shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged        for she did not scruple to call out          what is that you are saying  fitzwilliam ,2,test

4992, i am very glad to hear such a good account of her   said lady       catherine   and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to       excel if she does not practice a good deal           i assure you  madam   he replied   that she does not need such       advice ,2,train

4995,i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is       to be acquired without constant practice ,2,train
4996,i have told miss bennet       several times  that she will never play really well unless she       practises more  and though mrs  collins has no instrument  she is       very welcome  as i have often told her  to come to rosings every       day  and play on the pianoforte in mrs  jenkinson s room ,2,val
4997,she       would be in nobody s way  you know  in that part of the house          mr  darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding  and       made no answer ,2,train
4998,when coffee was over  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of       having promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the       instrument ,2,train
4999,he drew a chair near her ,2,val
5000,lady catherine listened to       half a song  and then talked  as before  to her other nephew        till the latter walked away from her  and making with his usual       deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to       command a full view of the fair performer s countenance ,2,train
5001,elizabeth saw what he was doing  and at the first convenient       pause  turned to him with an arch smile  and said          you mean to frighten me  mr  darcy  by coming in all this state       to hear me ,2,val
5002,i will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play       so well ,2,train
5003,there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to       be frightened at the will of others ,2,train
5004,my courage always rises at       every attempt to intimidate me           i shall not say you are mistaken   he replied   because you       could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming       you  and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough       to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing       opinions which in fact are not your own          elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said       to colonel fitzwilliam   your cousin will give you a very pretty       notion of me  and teach you not to believe a word i say ,2,train
5005,i am       particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose       my real character  in a part of the world where i had hoped to       pass myself off with some degree of credit ,2,train
5006,indeed  mr  darcy  it       is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my       disadvantage in hertfordshire and  give me leave to say  very       impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such       things may come out as will shock your relations to hear           i am not afraid of you   said he  smilingly ,2,val
5007, pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of   cried colonel       fitzwilliam ,2,test
5008, i should like to know how he behaves among       strangers           you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very       dreadful ,2,test
5009,the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire        you must know  was at a ball and at this ball  what do you think       he did ,2,train
5010,he danced only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce        and  to my certain knowledge  more than one young lady was       sitting down in want of a partner ,2,train
5011,mr  darcy  you cannot deny the       fact           i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the       assembly beyond my own party           true  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room ,2,train
5012,well        colonel fitzwilliam  what do i play next ,2,val
5013,my fingers wait your       orders           perhaps   said darcy   i should have judged better  had i sought       an introduction  but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to       strangers           shall we ask your cousin the reason of this   said elizabeth        still addressing colonel fitzwilliam ,2,train
5014, shall we ask him why a man       of sense and education  and who has lived in the world  is ill       qualified to recommend himself to strangers           i can answer your question   said fitzwilliam   without applying       to him ,2,val
5015,it is because he will not give himself the trouble           i certainly have not the talent which some people possess   said       darcy   of conversing easily with those i have never seen before ,2,train
5016,i cannot catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested       in their concerns  as i often see done           my fingers   said elizabeth   do not move over this instrument       in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do ,2,train
5017,they have       not the same force or rapidity  and do not produce the same       expression ,2,val
5018,but then i have always supposed it to be my own       fault because i will not take the trouble of practising ,2,train
5019,it is       not that i do not believe  my  fingers as capable as any other       woman s of superior execution          darcy smiled and said   you are perfectly right ,2,val
5020,you have       employed your time much better ,2,test
5021,no one admitted to the privilege       of hearing you can think anything wanting ,2,test
5022,we neither of us       perform to strangers          here they were interrupted by lady catherine  who called out to       know what they were talking of ,2,test
5023,elizabeth immediately began       playing again ,2,train
5024,lady catherine approached  and  after listening       for a few minutes  said to darcy          miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more        and could have the advantage of a london master ,2,train
5025,she has a very       good notion of fingering  though her taste is not equal to       anne s ,2,val
5026,anne would have been a delightful performer  had her       health allowed her to learn          elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his       cousin s praise  but neither at that moment nor at any other       could she discern any symptom of love  and from the whole of his       behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss       bingley  that he might have been just as likely to marry  her         had she been his relation ,2,train
5027,lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance        mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste ,2,test
5028,elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility        and  at the request of the gentlemen  remained at the instrument       till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home ,2,train
5029,chapter           elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning  and writing to       jane while mrs  collins and maria were gone on business into the       village  when she was startled by a ring at the door  the certain       signal of a visitor ,2,train
5030,as she had heard no carriage  she thought it       not unlikely to be lady catherine  and under that apprehension       was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape       all impertinent questions  when the door opened  and  to her very       great surprise  mr  darcy  and mr  darcy only  entered the room ,2,train
5031,he seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for       his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the       ladies were to be within ,2,test
5032,they then sat down  and when her enquiries after rosings were       made  seemed in danger of sinking into total silence ,2,val
5033,it was       absolutely necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in       this emergence recollecting  when  she had seen him last in       hertfordshire  and feeling curious to know what he would say on       the subject of their hasty departure  she observed          how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november  mr        darcy ,2,train
5034,it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr  bingley       to see you all after him so soon  for  if i recollect right  he       went but the day before ,2,test
5035,he and his sisters were well  i hope        when you left london           perfectly so  i thank you          she found that she was to receive no other answer  and  after a       short pause added          i think i have understood that mr  bingley has not much idea of       ever returning to netherfield again           i have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may       spend very little of his time there in the future ,2,train
5036,he has many       friends  and is at a time of life when friends and engagements       are continually increasing           if he means to be but little at netherfield  it would be better       for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely        for then we might possibly get a settled family there ,2,train
5037,but        perhaps  mr  bingley did not take the house so much for the       convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own  and we must       expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle           i should not be surprised   said darcy   if he were to give it       up as soon as any eligible purchase offers          elizabeth made no answer ,2,train
5038,she was afraid of talking longer of his       friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to       leave the trouble of finding a subject to him ,2,train
5039,he took the hint  and soon began with   this seems a very       comfortable house ,2,test
5040,lady catherine  i believe  did a great deal to       it when mr  collins first came to hunsford           i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her       kindness on a more grateful object           mr ,2,train
5041,collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a       wife           yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with       one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him        or have made him happy if they had ,2,train
5042,my friend has an excellent       understanding though i am not certain that i consider her       marrying mr  collins as the wisest thing she ever did ,2,train
5043,she seems       perfectly happy  however  and in a prudential light it is       certainly a very good match for her           it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a       distance of her own family and friends           an easy distance  do you call it ,2,train
5044,it is nearly fifty miles           and what is fifty miles of good road ,2,train
5045,little more than half a       day s journey ,2,train
5046,yes  i call it a very easy distance           i should never have considered the distance as one of the        advantages  of the match   cried elizabeth ,2,val
5047, i should never have       said mrs  collins was settled  near  her family           it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire ,2,val
5048,anything       beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn  i suppose  would       appear far          as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she       understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and       netherfield  and she blushed as she answered          i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near       her family ,2,train
5049,the far and the near must be relative  and depend on       many varying circumstances ,2,test
5050,where there is fortune to make the       expenses of travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil ,2,train
5051,but       that is not the case  here  ,2,test
5052,mr  and mrs  collins have a       comfortable income  but not such a one as will allow of frequent       journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself        near  her family under less than  half  the present distance          mr  darcy drew his chair a little towards her  and said    you        cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment ,2,val
5053, you        cannot have been always at longbourn          elizabeth looked surprised ,2,test
5054,the gentleman experienced some change       of feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the       table  and glancing over it  said  in a colder voice          are you pleased with kent          a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued  on either       side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of       charlotte and her sister  just returned from her walk ,2,train
5055,the        t te   t te  surprised them ,2,train
5056,mr  darcy related the mistake which       had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet  and after sitting a       few minutes longer without saying much to anybody  went away ,2,train
5057, what can be the meaning of this   said charlotte  as soon as he       was gone ,2,train
5058, my dear  eliza  he must be in love with you  or he       would never have called on us in this familiar way          but when elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very       likely  even to charlotte s wishes  to be the case  and after       various conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to       proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do  which was       the more probable from the time of year ,2,test
5059,all field sports were       over ,2,train
5060,within doors there was lady catherine  books  and a       billiard table  but gentlemen cannot always be within doors  and       in the nearness of the parsonage  or the pleasantness of the walk       to it  or of the people who lived in it  the two cousins found a       temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day ,2,test
5061,they called at various times of the morning  sometimes       separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by       their aunt ,2,train
5062,it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam       came because he had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which       of course recommended him still more  and elizabeth was reminded       by her own satisfaction in being with him  as well as by his       evident admiration of her  of her former favourite george       wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw there was less       captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners  she       believed he might have the best informed mind ,2,train
5063,but why mr  darcy came so often to the parsonage  it was more       difficult to understand ,2,train
5064,it could not be for society  as he       frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his       lips  and when he did speak  it seemed the effect of necessity       rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety  not a pleasure to       himself ,2,train
5065,he seldom appeared really animated ,2,train
5066,mrs  collins knew       not what to make of him ,2,train
5067,colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally       laughing at his stupidity  proved that he was generally       different  which her own knowledge of him could not have told       her  and as she would liked to have believed this change the       effect of love  and the object of that love her friend eliza  she       set herself seriously to work to find it out ,2,train
5068,she watched him       whenever they were at rosings  and whenever he came to hunsford        but without much success ,2,train
5069,he certainly looked at her friend a       great deal  but the expression of that look was disputable ,2,val
5070,it       was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often doubted whether       there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it seemed nothing       but absence of mind ,2,train
5071,she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of       his being partial to her  but elizabeth always laughed at the       idea  and mrs  collins did not think it right to press the       subject  from the danger of raising expectations which might only       end in disappointment  for in her opinion it admitted not of a       doubt  that all her friend s dislike would vanish  if she could       suppose him to be in her power ,2,train
5072,in her kind schemes for elizabeth  she sometimes planned her       marrying colonel fitzwilliam ,2,train
5073,he was beyond comparison the most       pleasant man  he certainly admired her  and his situation in life       was most eligible  but  to counterbalance these advantages  mr        darcy had considerable patronage in the church  and his cousin       could have none at all ,2,train
