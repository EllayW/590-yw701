Monday or Tuesday,Practical Agitation, Pride and Prejudice are chosen to be the text data.
By Train/Validation/Test Split, here are the data shape:
X_train is 3247
X_val is 812
X_test is 1015

Train by RNN:
1. embedding layer with 32 layers
2. LSTM layer with 64 layers
3. Dense layer, reduce the dimension to 3 for classification.
4. compile with rmsprop optimizer.

Hyperparamters:
1. epoches number:5
2. Kfold k =1
3. Mini-batch
4. Ridge for regulation
5. 1000 for max_features
6. 100 for maxlen

Train by CNN:
1. embedding layer with 32 layers
2. conv1d layer with kernel size = 3x3 and 128 layers
3. MaxPooling1D layer
4. Dense layer with 64 layers and relu as activation function
5. Dense layer for classification and softmax as activation function
6. compile with rmsprop optimizer.

Hyperparamters:
